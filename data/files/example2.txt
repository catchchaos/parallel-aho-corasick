== The Month ==

April comes between [[March]] and [[May]], making it the fourth month of the year. It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as [[June]], [[September]] and [[November]] are later in the year. It starts on the same day of the week as [[July]] every year, and starts on the same day as [[January]] in [[leap year]]s. In a [[common year]], April starts on the same day of the week as [[October]] of the previous year, and in [[leap year]]s starts on the same day as [[May]] of the previous year.
April ends on the same day of the week as [[December]] every year. In a [[common year]], it ends on the same day as [[July]] of the previous year. In a [[leap year]], it ends on the same day as [[October]] of the previous year.

April is a [[spring]] month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and an [[autumn|autumn/fall]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the [[season]]al equivalent of [[October]] in the other.

It is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the [[Latin]] word "aperire", meaning "to open", referring to [[flower]]s opening in [[spring]]. Another theory is that the name could come from [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of [[love]]. It was originally the second month in the old Roman [[Calendar]], before the start of the new year was put to [[January 1]].

Quite a few festivals are held in this month. In many [[Southeast Asia]]n cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including [[Songkran]]). In Western [[Christianity]], [[Easter]] can be celebrated on a [[Sunday]] between [[March 22]] and [[April 25]]. In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christianity, it can fall between [[April 4]] and [[May 8]]. At the end of the month, Central and Northern [[Europe]]an [[culture]]s celebrate [[Walpurgis Night]] on [[April 30]], marking the transition from [[winter]] into [[summer]].

== April in poetry ==
[[poetry|Poets]] use ''April'' to mean the end of winter. For example: ''April showers bring [[May]] flowers.''

{{Months}}{{monththisyear|8}}
'''August''' is the eighth [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], coming between [[July]] and [[September]]. It has 31 [[day]]s, the same number of days as the previous month, [[July]], and is named after Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]].

== The Month ==
[[File:Hw-augustus.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]], after whom August is named]]
This month was first called ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]], because it was the sixth month in the old [[Roman calendar]]. The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]]. [[October]] was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700 BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the [[decemvirs]] about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree). In [[153 BC]] [[January 1]] was determined as the beginning of the year.

August is named for [[Augustus Caesar]] who became [[Roman consul]] in this month.<ref name="infoplease">{{Citation |title=History of August |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/history-of-august.html }}</ref>  The month has 31 days because [[Julius Caesar]] added two days when he created the [[Julian calendar]] in [[45 BC]]. August is after July and before September.

August, in either [[hemisphere]], is the seasonal equivalent of [[February]] in the other. In the [[Northern hemisphere]] it is a [[summer]] month and it is a [[winter]] month in the [[Southern hemisphere]]. In a [[common year]], no other month begins on the same day of the week as August, though in [[leap year]]s, [[February]] starts on the same day as August. August always ends on the same day of the week as [[November]].

August's flower is the [[Gladiolus]] with the birthstone being [[peridot]]. The astrological signs for August are Leo ([[July 24]] - [[August 22]]) and Virgo ([[August 23]] - [[September 23]]).

'''Art''' is a creative activity by people. The artist hopes that it affects the emotions of people who experience it. Artists express themselves by their art. 

Many people disagree on how to define art. Some say people are driven to make art due to their inner [[creativity]]. 

Art includes [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpting]], [[photography]], [[Performing arts|performance art]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[poetry]], [[prose]] and [[theatre]].

== Types of art ==
Art is divided into the [[plastic arts]], where something is made, and the [[performing arts]], where something is done by humans in action. The other division is between pure arts, done for themselves, and practical arts, done for a practical purpose, but with artistic content.
*Plastic arts
**Fine art is expression by making something [[Beauty|beautiful]] or appealing to the [[emotion]]s by visual means: [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]], [[sculpture]]
**Literature: [[poetry]], creative [[writing]]
*Performing arts
**Performing art including [[drama]] are (expression using the body: [[dance]], [[acting]], [[singing]])
**Auditory art (expression by making [[sound]]s): [[music]], [[singing]]
*Practical arts
** Culinary art (expression by making [[flavor]]s and [[taste]]s): [[cooking]] 
** The practical arts (expression by making things and structures: [[architecture]], [[Movie|filming]], [[fashion]], [[photography]], [[video games]])

== What "art" means ==
Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the [[mind|human mind]], [[spirit]] and [[soul]].

An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the amount of people who can relate to it, and how much people appreciate it.

The first and broadest sense of "art" means "arrangement" or "to arrange." In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design.

Art can also be a form of expression of [[emotion]]. The artist may feel a certain emotion and feels there is no other way to express it than to create something that means something to them. Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an audience. Though if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well, then the art work will become publicly successful.

== History of art ==

There are sculptures, [[cave painting]] and [[rock art]] dating from the Upper [[Paleolithic]] era.

All of the great ancient civilizations, such as Ancient [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Greece]], [[Rome]] or [[Arabia]] had works and styles of art. In the [[Middle Ages]], most of the art in [[Europe]] showed people from the [[Bible]] in [[painting]]s, [[stained glass]] windows, and [[mosaic]] tile floors and walls.

[[Islamic]] art includes [[geometric]] patterns, Islamic [[calligraphy]], and [[architecture]]. In [[India]] and [[Tibet]], painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included [[jade]] carving, bronzework, [[pottery]], [[poetry]], calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty.

In Europe, after the [[Middle Ages]], there was a "[[Renaissance]]" which means "rebirth". People rediscovered [[science]] and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] where things in the distance look smaller than things close up in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other.

In the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to [[Industrialization|Modernity]] created many new painting styles such as [[Classicism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Realism]], and [[Impressionism]]. The history of twentieth century art includes [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]]ism, [[Surrealism]], and [[Minimalism]].

== Roles of art ==

In some [[society|societies]], people think that art belongs to the person who made it, such as Indigenous Aboriginal Australian Art. They think that the artist put his or her "[[talent]]" into the art. In this view, the art is the [[property]] of the artist.

In other societies, people think that art belongs to no one. They think that society has put its [[social capital]] into the artist and the artist's work. In this view, society is a [[collective]] that has made the art, through the artist.

=== Functions of art ===

The [[wikt:simple:function|functions]] of art include:<ref>{{cite book |last=Bagdasaryan |first=Nadejda |title=Culturology |year=2000 |language=Russian |ISBN=5-06-003475-5 |pages=511 |chapter=7. Art as a phenomenon of culture}}</ref>

1) Cognitive function

:Works of art let us know about what the author knew, and about what the surrounding of the author were like.

2) Aesthetic function

:Works of art are more or less harmonic and bring pleasure, a sensation of beauty.

3) Prognostic function

:Some artists draw what they see the future like, and some of them are right, but most are not...

4) Recreation function

:Art makes us think about it, not about reality; we have a rest.

5) Value function

:What did the artist value? What aims did he like/dislike in human activity? This usually is clearly seen in artists' works.

6) Didactic function

:What message, criticism or political change did the artist wish to achieve?

{{A-Z}}
[[File:A cursiva.gif|thumb]]
'''A''' is the first letter of the [[English language|English]] [[alphabet]]. The small letter, '''a''', is used as a lower case [[vowel]]. However, the English long '''a''' (ā) is said as a [[diphthong]] of ĕ and y. The same letter of the [[Greek alphabet]] is named [[alpha (letter)|alpha]]. Alpha and [[omega (letter)|omega]], the last letter of the Greek alphabet, means the beginning and the end. In [[musical notation]], the letter A is the symbol of a note in the scale, below [[B]] and above [[G]]. In [[binary]] numbers, the letter A is 01000001.

A is the letter that was used to represent a team in an old [[TV]] show, [[The A-Team]].

==Where it came from==
The earliest letter 'A' has appeared was in the Phoenician alphabet's [[aleph]].<ref name="Britannica"/> This symbol came from a simple picture of an [[ox]] head. 
{| class="wikitable"
|- style="background-color:#EEEEEE; text-align:center;"

|[[File:Alpha uc lc.svg|65px|Greek alpha]]
|[[File:EtruscanA.svg|Etruscan A]]
|[[File:RomanA-01.svg|Roman A]]
|}

This Phoenician letter helped make the basic blocks of later types of the letter. The Greeks later modified this letter and used it as their letter [[Alpha (letter)|alpha]]. The Greek alphabet was used by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] in northern Italy, and the Romans later modified the Etruscan alphabet for their own language.

==Using the letter==
The letter A has six different sounds. It can sound like æ, in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], such as the word ''pad''. Other sounds of this letter are in the words ''father'', which developed into another sound, such as in the word ''ace''.

==Use in mathematics==
In algebra, the letter "A" along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities.

In geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to label [[line segment]]s, [[Line (geomotry)|lines]], etc. Also, A is typically used as one of the letters to label an angle in a triangle.

'''Air''' is the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]]. Air around us is a mixture of many gases and dust particles. It is the clear [[gas]] in which living things live and [[breathe]]. It has an indefinite shape and volume. It has no [[color]] or [[odor|smell]]. It has [[mass]] and [[weight]]. It is a [[matter]] as it has mass and weight. Air creates [[atmosphere pressure|atmospheric  pressure]]. There is no air in the [[vacuum]] of the [[cosmos]]. 

Air is a [[mixture]] of about 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% [[oxygen]], 0.9% [[argon]], 0.04% [[carbon dioxide]], and very small amounts of other gases.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://mistupid.com/chemistry/aircomp.htm|title=composition of air}}</ref><ref>Zimmer, Carl (3 October 2013).

Animals need the [[oxygen]] in the air to live. In the [[human body]], the [[lung]]s give oxygen to the [[blood]], and give back [[carbon dioxide]] to the air. Plants need the carbon dioxide in the air to live. They give off oxygen that humans can breathe again.  

[[Wind]] is moving air.  Air [[air pollution|can be polluted]] by some gases (such as   [[carbon monoxide]]), [[smoke]], and [[wikt:ash|ash]]. This [[pollution]] is one of the reasons for [[global warming]], by causing the "[[greenhouse effect]]".

Aircraft use [[propeller]]s to move air over a [[wing]], which allows them to [[flight|fly]]. [[Pneumatics]] use [[air pressure]] to move things.

[[Category:Atmosphere]][[Spain]] is divided in 17 parts called '''autonomous communities'''. ''Autonomous'' means that each of these autonomous communities has its own Executive Power, its own Legislative Power and its own Judicial Power. These are similar, but NOT the same, to states in the [[United States]] of America, for example.

Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces. In [[1978]] these parts came together, making the autonomous communities. 
Before then, some of these provinces were together but were broken. The groups that were together once before are called "historic communities": Catalonia, Basque Country, Galicia and Andalusia.

The Spanish language is the official language in every autonomous community but six, which also have other official languages:
* [[Catalonia]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]])
* [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], also called [[Valencian language|Valencian]] there)
* [[Balearic Islands]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]])
* [[Galicia]] ([[Galician language|Galician]])
* [[:en:Basque_Country|Basque Country]] ([[Basque language|Basque]])
* [[Navarre]] ([[basque language|Basque]], but only in the north and near the border with Euskadi)

List of the autonomous communities, with their Capital city (the place where the government has its offices):

* [[Andalusia]] (its capital is [[Sevilla]])
* [[Aragon]] (its capital is [[Zaragoza]])
* [[Asturias]] (its capital is [[Oviedo]])
* [[Balearic Islands]] (its capital is [[Palma de Mallorca]])
* [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (its capital is [[Vitoria]])
* [[Canary Islands]] (they have two capitals - [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] and [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]])
* [[Cantabria]] (its capital is [[Santander, Spain|Santander]])
* [[Castile-La Mancha]] (its capital is [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]])
* [[Castile and León]] (its capital is [[Valladolid]])
* [[Catalonia]] (its capital is [[Barcelona]])
* [[Extremadura]] (its capital is [[Mérida]])
* [[Galicia]] (its capital is [[Santiago de Compostela]])
* [[La Rioja]] (its capital is [[Logroño]])
* [[Community of Madrid]] (its capital is [[Madrid]])
* [[Region of Murcia]] (its capital is [[Murcia]])
* [[Navarre]] (its capital is [[Pamplona]])
* [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]] (its capital is [[Valencia]])

Spain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa: [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. They are called "autonomous cities" and have simultaneously the majority of the power of an autonomous community and also power of provinces and power of municipalities.

[[Category:Autonomous communities of Spain| ]][[File:Alan Turing Memorial Closer.jpg|right|thumb|A [[statue]] of Alan Turing]]
[[File:Bombe-rebuild.jpg|thumb|right|A rebuild of a machine made by Alan Turing]]

'''Alan Mathison Turing''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] [[FRS]] ([[London]], 23 June 1912 – [[Wilmslow]], [[Cheshire]], 7 June 1954) was an [[English people|English]] [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]]. He was born in [[Maida Vale]], London.<ref>Newman M.H.A. 1955. Alan Mathison Turing. 1912–1954. ''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' '''1''': 253. [http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/253]</ref>

== Young Life and Family ==
Alan Turing was born in Maida Vale, London. His father was part of a family of [[Merchant|merchants]] from Scotland. His mother, Ethel Sara, was the [[daughter]] of an [[engineer]].

=== Education ===
Turing went to St. Michael's, a school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-sea, when he was six years old.

== Career ==
Turing was one of the people who worked on the first [[computers]]. He was the first person to think of using a computer to do things that were too hard for a person to do. He created the [[Turing machine]] in 1936. The machine was [[Imagination|imaginary]], but it included the idea of a [[computer program]]. 

Turing was interested in [[artificial intelligence]]. He proposed the [[Turing test]], to say when a machine could be called "[[Intelligence|intelligent]]". A computer could be said to "think" if a human talking with it could not tell it was a machine.<ref>Harnad, Stevan 2008.  [http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7741 The Annotation game: Turing (1950) on Computing, machinery and intelligence]. In: Epstein, Robert & Peters, Grace (eds) ''Parsing the Turing Test: philosophical and methodological issues in the quest for the thinking computer''. Springer</ref>

During [[World War II]], Turing worked to break [[Germany|German]] [[cipher]]s (secret messages). Using [[cryptanalysis]] he helped to break the codes of the [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] machine. After that, he solved other German codes.

From 1945 to 1947, Turing worked on the design of the [[ACE (computer)|ACE]] (Automatic Computing Engine) at the [[National Physical Laboratory]]. He presented a paper on 19 February 1946. That paper was "the first detailed design of a [[stored-program computer]]".<ref>Copeland, B. Jack 2006. ''Colossus: The secrets of Bletchley Park's code-breaking computers''. Oxford University Press. p108 ISBN 978-0-19-284055-4</ref> Although it was possible to build ACE, there were delays in starting the project. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year. While he was at Cambridge, the [[Pilot ACE]] was built without him. It ran its first program on 10&nbsp;May 1950.

== Private life ==
Turing was a [[homosexual]] man. In 1952, he admitted having had sex with a man in [[England]]. At that time, [[homosexual]] acts were illegal. Turing was [[conviction|convicted]]. He had to choose between going to [[jail]] and taking [[hormone]]s to lower his sex drive. He decided to take the hormones.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letters of Note: Yours in distress, Alan |last=Turing |first=Alan |year=1952 |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/yours-in-distress-alan.html |archivedate=December 16, 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CxLiSeL9}}</ref> After his punishment, he became [[erectile dysfunction|impotent]]. He also grew [[breast]]s.<ref>{{cite book | title=Alan Turing: The Enigma The Centenary Edition | publisher=Princeton University | author=Andrew Hodges | year=2012}}</ref>

In May 2012, a [[private member's bill]] was put before the [[House of Lords]] to grant Turing a statutory [[pardon]].<ref name=Guardian-Pardon>{{cite web|title=Parliamentary bill launched for Alan Turing pardon|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/25/alan-turing-private-members-bill-lord-sharkey|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> In July 2013, the government supported it.<ref name=turingguardian19july2013>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk-news/2013/jul/19/enigma-codebreaker-alan-turing-posthumous-pardon|title=Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing to be given posthumous pardon|publisher=The Guardian|date=19 July 2013|author=Nicholas Watt}}</ref> A royal pardon was granted on 24<!-- Mercy is effective from 24 December although it was announced on the night of 23rd --> December 2013.<ref name=turingindependent24dec2013>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/alan-turing-gets-his-royal-pardon-for-gross-indecency--61-years-after-he-poisoned-himself-9023116.html|title=Alan Turing gets his royal pardon for 'gross indecency' – 61 years after he poisoned himself|publisher=The Independent|date=23 December 2013|Author=Oliver Wright}}</ref><ref name=turingpardoncryptome24dec2013>{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/2013/12/turing-pardon.pdf|title=(Archived copy of) Royal Pardon for Alan Turing}}</ref>

== Death ==
In 1954, after suffering for two years, Turing died from [[cyanide]] poisoning. The cyanide came from either an [[apple]] which was poisoned with [[cyanide]], or from water that had cyanide in it. The reason for the confusion is that the police never tested the apple for cyanide.<ref>Hodges, Andrew 1983. ''Alan Turing: the enigma''. London: Burnett Books, p488. ISBN 0-04-510060-8</ref>It is also suspected that he committed suicide. 

The treatment forced on him is now believed to be very wrong. It is against [[medical ethics]] and international laws of [[human rights]]. In August 2009, a [[petition]] asking the [[British Government]] to apologise to Turing for punishing him for being a homosexual was started.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Thousands call for Turing apology |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8226509.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=31&nbsp;August 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | title = Petition seeks apology for Enigma code-breaker Turing | url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/09/01/alan.turing.petition/index.html | publisher=CNN | date = 01&nbsp;September 2009 | accessdate =1 September 2009}}</ref> The petition received thousands of signatures.<ref>The petition was only open to UK citizens.</ref> [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] acknowledged the petition.

'''Andouille''' is a type of [[pork]] [[sausage]]. It is spicy (hot in taste) and smoked. There are different kinds, all with different combinations of pork [[meat]], [[fat]], [[intestines]] (tubes going to the [[stomach]]), and [[tripe]] (the wall of the stomach). Andouille sausage first came from [[France]] or [[Germany]] (no-one is sure), but the name indicates that it may have come out from France, and the most famous sort in the [[United States|USA]] is the "Cajun" style. 

Other sorts are "French andouille" and "German andouille"; they are less spicy than Cajun. Cajun has extra [[sodium chloride|salt]], [[black pepper]], and [[garlic]]. Andouille makers smoke the sausages over pecan wood and sugar cane for a maximum of seven or eight hours, at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees Celsius).

'''Farming''' is growing [[crop]]s or keeping animals by people for [[food]] and [[raw material]]s. Farming is a part of [[agriculture]].

== History ==
Agriculture started thousands of years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is.<ref>Colin Tudge argues "from at least 40,000 years ago... people were managing their environment to such an extent that they can properly be called 'proto-farmers'". Tudge, Colin 1998. ''Neanderthals, bandits and farmers: how agriculture really began''. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, p3. ISBN 0-297-84258-7</ref> The development of farming gave rise to the [[Neolithic Revolution]] whereby people gave up [[nomad]]ic [[hunting]] and settled in what became [[cities]].

Agriculture and [[domestication]] probably started in the [[Fertile Crescent]] (the [[Nile]] Valley, The [[Levant]] and [[Mesopotamia]]).<ref>Harris, David (ed) 1996. ''The origins and spread of agriculture and pastoralism in [[Eurasia]]: crops, fields, flocks and herds''. University College London Press. ISBN 1-56098-675-1</ref> The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], and [[Egypt]]. [[Wheat]] and [[barley]] are some of the first crops people grew. People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild. People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. Farming can feed many more people than [[hunter-gatherer]]s can feed on the same amount of land.

== Overview ==
Agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals, but also growing other things like [[flower]]s and [[nursery]] [[plant]]s, manure or dung, [[animal hides]] (skins or furs), [[leather]], animals, fungi, [[fiber]]s ([[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], and [[flax]]), [[biofuel]]s , and [[drug]]s (bio[[pharmaceuticals]], [[marijuana]], [[opium]]).

Many people live by doing what is called [[subsistence agriculture]], on a small farm. Only the farmer's family lives on the farm. Subsistence agriculture is growing only enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals. Extra food or animals are sold for money or other things the farmer cannot grow. The [[yield]] is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and it is often low. This is because subsistence farmers are generally less [[education|educated]], and they have less [[money]] to buy equipment. [[Drought]] and other problems sometimes cause [[famine]]s. Where yields are low, [[forests]] are sometimes cut to provide new land to grow more food. This is good in the short term, but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years.

In rich countries, farms are often much larger. The amount produced on farms has got bigger in the last one hundred years because farmers are able to grow better [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests. Many farms also use machines, which cut down on the number of people needed to farm the land. There are fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farmers are able to grow more. 

This kind of [[intensive agriculture]] comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, [[pesticide]]s (chemicals that kill bugs), and [[herbicide]]s (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can [[pollute]] the [[soil]] or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by [[erosion]] (blowing or washing away), salt buildup, or loss of structure. [[Irrigation]] (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. These problems have all got solutions, and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education.

=== Agriculture techniques ===
* [[Fertilizer]]s
* [[Crop rotation]]
* [[Weed]] removal
* [[Breeding]]
* [[Agricultural fencing|Fencing]]
* [[Ranching]]

Farmers select plants with better yield, taste, and [[nutrition]]al value.  They also choose plants that can survive [[plant disease]] and drought, and are easier to harvest.  Centuries of [[artificial selection]] and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. The crops produce better yield with other techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, irrigation).

Some companies have been searching for new plants in poor countries, and genetically modify these plants to improve them. They then try to patent the seeds and sell them back to the poor countries.

New plants were created with [[genetic engineering]]. One example of [[genetic engineering]] is modifying a plant to resist a herbicide.

== Food ==
It is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and good. People say it is not always safe, because it contains some chemicals. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this reason, there are several types of agriculture.
* Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries.
* Intensive agriculture is mostly done in countries with more money. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical fertilizers. 
* Organic farming is using only natural products such as compost and green manure. 
* Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process.

[[Agricultural policy]] focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include:

* [[Food safety]]: to be sure that the food supply is safe.
* [[Food security]]: to be sure there is enough food for everyone.
* [[Food quality]]: to be sure the food is of good quality.

== Problems in agriculture ==
There are some serious problems that people face trying to grow food today.
These include:
* [[Erosion]]
* [[Diseases]]
* [[Pests]]
* [[Weed]]s
* [[Drought]]
* [[Rainfall]]

== Crops ==
The major crops produced in the world in 2002, are maize (corn), wheat, rice, and cotton.

*[[Maize]] 624 millions of metric tons
*[[Wheat]] 570 millions of metric tons
*[[Rice]] 381.1 millions of metric tons
*[[Cotton]] 96.5 millions of metric tons

[[Category:Agriculture| ]]'''Arithmetic''' is a name for working with [[number]]s. It is a part of [[mathematics]]. The four basic arithmetic operations are [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[Division (mathematics)|division]].

Harder arithmetic includes working with [[signed number]]s, [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], and [[decimal]]s, and taking [[power (math)|powers]] and [[root (math)|roots]].

Most people learn arithmetic in [[primary school]], but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned. Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic, and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic. A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include [[carpenter]]s, [[plumber]]s, [[automobile mechanic|auto mechanics]], [[accountant]]s, [[architect]]s, [[Medical doctor|doctors]], and [[nurse]]s. Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics, [[science]], and [[engineering]]. 

A [[calculator]] can be used to do arithmetic. [[Computer]]s can do it more quickly, which is one reason [[Global Positioning System]] receivers have a small computer inside. 

== Examples of arithmetic ==

* 2 + 3 = 5 (adding is [[commutative property|commutative]]: 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2)

* 7 - 5 = 2 (subtracting is not commutative: 7 - 5 is different from 5 - 7)

* 3 * 4 = 12 (multiplying is commutative: 3 * 4 is the same as 4 * 3)

* 6 / 2 = 3 (dividing is not commutative: 6 / 2 is different from 2 / 6)

[[Category:Arithmetics]]{{redirect|Add|other articles with the same name|ADD (disambiguation)}}
[[Image:Addition.gif|thumb|220px|Addition ]]

'''Addition''' is the [[mathematics|mathematical]] way of putting things together.

== Arithmetic ==

In [[arithmetic]], addition is finding the total of two or more [[number]]s. The sign for addition is "+". The name for the sign "+" is "plus".  
Another name for the total is the [[sum]].

=== Counting examples ===
For example, there are [[wikt:object|objects]] in two [[group]]s. The objects are small circles: "o". One group has five of these objects. The other group has 3 of these objects. To find the total number of objects in both groups, the objects can be counted. Another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group.  

====Adding====

Another method is to add the numbers of objects in group A and group B, since they are already counted. In symbols:

:{{math|5 + 3}}

There are [[rule]]s for adding numbers that people [[learn]]. There are also rules for adding numbers that are built into machines ([[binary adder]]). The rule says that:

:{{math|{{aao|5|3|+}}}}

In another counting example, Sally and Bill have 2 children. Sally and Bill get 3 more children. Sally and Bill have added three children to their two children and now have five children.

'''Vertical Addition'''

The animation above demonstrates the addition of seven hundred and eighty six and four hundred and sixty seven, the problems digits have been separated into units, tens and hundreds ([[place value]]).  First the units 6 and 7 are added together to make 13, so 1 ten and 3 units, the 3 is written below and the 1 ten is carried to the tens column. Next in the tens column the 1, 8 and 6 are added together to make 15 tens, so 1 hundred and 5 tens, the 5 is written below and the 1 hundred is carried to the hundreds column. Finally in the hundreds column 1, 7 and 4 are added together to make 12 hundreds, so 1 thousand and 2 hundreds, the 2 is written below and the 1 thousand is carried to the thousand column. Giving the answer one thousand two hundred and fifty three.

===A measurement example===
Tom wants to know the distance between his house and Sally's house. Bob's house is 300 meters  east of Tom's house. Sally's house is 120 meters east of Bob's house:

:Tom's house<------------300 meters-------------->Bob's house<-----120 meters----->Sally's house

The distance from Tom's house to Sally's house can be found by adding the distances already measured. The distance from Tom's house to Bob's house added to the distance from Bob's house to Sally's house is the same as the distance from Tom's house to Sally's house. That is, three hundred (300) meters plus 120 meters.
:{{math|{{aao|300|120|+}}}}

== Addition as increase ==
Addition can also mean to make bigger.

=== Example of addition as increase ===
* For example, Tom has a house. Tom puts a new room on the house. This new room is called an addition.

* John is making [[food]]. To make the food [[taste]] better, John puts [[salt]] in the food. That is, John adds salt to the food. The [[salt]] is a [[food additive]] or addition to the food.

'''Australia''' is a [[country]] in the [[southern hemisphere]] between the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Indian Ocean]].  Its official name is the '''Commonwealth of Australia'''. Australia is the sixth biggest country in the world by landmass, and is part of the [[Oceania|Oceanic]] and [[Australasia]]n regions. The Australian [[emblem]] is a flower called the Golden Wattle. 

23{{ndash}}24 million people live in Australia, and about 80% of them live on the east coast. About 60% live in and around the mainland state capitals of [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Adelaide]]. Australia's capital city is [[Canberra]].

Australia is known for its [[mining]] and for its production of [[wool]]. Australia is the world's largest producer of [[bauxite]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mams.rmit.edu.au/0wzm6liriybr1.PDF|title=Alcola World Alumina Australia|publisher=MAMS.RMIT.edu.au|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref>

Australia, [[New Zealand]], [[New Guinea]] and other islands on the Australian [[tectonic plate]] are together called [[Australasia]]. They form one of the world's great [[ecozone]]s. When other Pacific islands are included, the term is [[Oceania]].

== Geography ==
[[File:As-map.png|thumbnail|left|Map of Australia]]
Australia's landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometers is on the [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian plate]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Turner | first=Kate | year=2008 | title=National Geographic Australia | publisher=Horupu | location=Tokyo | page=pp.8}}</ref>
The continent of Australia, including the island of Tasmania, was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago. Because of this, many [[animals]] and [[plants]] live in Australia that do not live anywhere else. These include animals like the [[kangaroo]], the [[koala]], the [[emu]], the [[kookaburra]], and the [[platypus]].

People first arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. These native Australians are called the [[Australian Aborigine]]s. For the history of Australia, see [[History of Australia]].

Most of the Australian colonies, having been settled from [[Britain]], became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on 1 January 1901. The first [[Prime Minister of Australia]] was [[Edmund Barton]] in 1901. Australia is a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Queen Elizabeth II|Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Australia and Head of State and a [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] who is chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out all the duties of the Queen in Australia.

=== Regions and cities ===
{{Other pages|List of Cities in Australia}}
Australia has six states, two major mainland territories, and other minor territories. The states are [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[Western Australia]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Cummins | first=Brian R. | year=1990 | title=Australia | publisher= the Australian Government Publishing Service | location=Canberra | pages= 16-17 }}</ref> The two major mainland territories are the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT).

In 2013 according to world bank Australia had just over 23.13 million people. Most Australians live in cities along the coast, such as [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Darwin, Australia|Darwin]], [[Hobart]] and [[Adelaide]]. The largest inland city is [[Canberra]], which is also the nation's capital. The largest city is Sydney.<ref>{{cite book | title= Oceania South Pole | author= Tanabe Yu | year= 1997 | publisher= Asakura Bookstore | location= Shinjyuku ward | page= 3179 }}</ref>

Australia is a very big country, but much of the land is very dry, and the middle of the continent is mostly [[desert]]. Only the areas around the east, west and south coast have enough rain and a suitable [[climate]] (not too hot) for many [[farm]]s and [[cities]].

== History ==
=== Aboriginal people ===
[[File:Corroboree.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Arrernte men of Central Australia in a [[Corroboree]] in 1900.]]

The [[Australian Aborigine|Australian Aboriginal]] people arrived in Australia about 50,000 years ago or even earlier.<ref>Hesp, Patrick A. ''et al'' 1999. Aboriginal occupation on Rottnest Island, Western Australia, provisionally dated by aspartic acid racemisation assay of land snails to greater than 50 ka. ''Australian Archaeology'', No 49 (1999)</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.stonepages.com/news/archives/000236.html |title=Stone Pages Archaeo News: Australia colonized earlier than previously thought? |first= |last= |work=stonepages.com |year=2003 |accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=The history of Australia |author=Takao Fujikawa |year=2004|publisher=Yuhikaku ARMA |location=Tokyo |page=4}}</ref> Until the arrival of British settlers in 1788, the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land. They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways. An example of Aboriginal land management was the [[Cumberland Plain]] where Sydney is now. Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees.{{Citation}} This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people. Sometimes, Aborigines would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population.

Aboriginal people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, and there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]].{{Citation}} The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making. The [[boomerang]] was used in some areas for sport and for hunting.

The Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them. They believed that they had grown from the land, so it was like their mother, and they belonged to the land.

=== Terra Australis ===
In the 1600s, [[Dutch people|Dutch]] merchants traded with the islands of [[Batavia]] (now [[Indonesia]]), to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia. The Dutch governor, van Diemen, sent [[Abel Tasman]] on a voyage of discovery and he found [[Tasmania]], which he named [[Van Diemen's Land]]. Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it.

The [[British Government]] was sure that there must be a very large land in the south, that had not been explored. They sent Captain [[James Cook]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. His ship, ''[[HMS Endeavour]]'', carried the famous scientists, Sir [[Joseph Banks]] and Dr Solander who were going to [[Tahiti]] where they would watch the planet [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] pass in front of the [[Sun]]. Captain Cook's secret mission was to find "[[Terra Australis]]" (the Land of the South).

The voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found [[New Zealand]] and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the [[horizon]]. Captain Cook named that bit of land [[Point Hicks]]. They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw "New South Wales". At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collected hundreds of plants to take back to England.

Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the government that no-one owned the land. This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.

=== Settlement ===
[[File:The Founding of Australia. By Capt. Arthur Phillip R.N. Sydney Cove, Jan. 26th 1788.jpg|thumb|Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] raises the British flag at [[Sydney]] in 1788.]]

In the 1700s, in England, laws were tough, many people were poor and [[gaol]]s ([[jail]]s) were full. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hung for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British colonies in America. But by the 1770s, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England's convicts any more, so England needed to find a new and less populated place.

By the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the [[First Fleet]] of eleven ships set sail from [[Portsmouth]] carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain [[Arthur Phillip]]. They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists.

Captain Phillip found that [[Botany Bay]] was flat and windy. There was not much fresh water. He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbor which he said was "the finest harbor in the world!" There were many small bays on the harbor so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on. On 26 January 1788, the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] of England, and the new settlement was called Sydney.

For the first few years of the settlement, things were very difficult. No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony. Nobody had chosen them carefully. There was only one man who was a farmer. There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder, a brick-maker or a blacksmith. No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke. All of the cattle escaped. There were no cooking pots. All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten. It was probable that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation.

Somehow, the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor, Arthur Phillip, and another hut for the supply of food, grew into a small town with streets, a bridge over the stream, a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships. By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor. There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today. Settlements had spread out from Sydney, firstly to [[Norfolk Island]] and to [[Van Diemen's Land]] (Tasmania), and also up the coast to Newcastle, where coal was discovered, and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd. Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney, and by 1820, farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England.

While the settlement was growing in New South Wales, it was also growing in Tasmania. The climate in Tasmania was more like that in England, and farmers found it easy to grow crops there.

=== Exploration ===
[[File:Ln-Governor-Lachlan macquarie.jpg|thumb|Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was the 5th [[governor of New South Wales]] and one who though that Australia could be a rich and free place.]]

Because Australia is such a very large land, it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people. In the early days of the colony, a great number of explorers went out, searching for good land to settle on.
When the settlers looked west from Sydney, they saw a range of mountains which they called the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]]. They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no-one could find their way through them. In 1813 [[Gregory Blaxland]], [[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]] and a 17-year-old called [[William Charles Wentworth]] crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming. A road was built and the governor, [[Lachlan Macquarie]] founded the town of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] on the other side, 100&nbsp;miles from Sydney.

Some people, like Captain [[Charles Sturt]] were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it. Many of the explorers did not prepare very well, or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year. Some died like Burke and Wills. [[Ludwig Leichhardt]] got lost twice. The second time, he was never seen again. Major [[Thomas Mitchell]] was one of the most successful explorers. He mapped the country as he went, and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years. He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria, and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there. The [[Henty Brothers|Henty brothers]] had come from [[Tasmania]], had built themselves a house, had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine.

===Self government===

The gold rushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold. The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry. By 1853 the gold rushes had made some poor people, very rich.

The transportation of convicts to Australia ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. The first governments in the colonies were run by governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy. [[William Wentworth]] started the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]]. In 1840, the city councils started and some people could vote. [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] had its first elections in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. In 1855, limited self-government was given by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In 1855, the [[right to vote]] was given to all men over 21 in [[South Australia]]. The other colonies soon followed. Women were given the vote in the [[Parliament of South Australia]] in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections.<ref name="aec.gov.au">{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=AEC.gov.au |publisher=AEC.gov.au |date=25 Oct. 2007 |accessdate=27 Jun. 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8 Documenting Democracy] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/60vtMmmE7|date =2011-08-14}}</ref>

Australians had started parliamentary democracies all across the continent. But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament.

=== The Commonwealth of Australia ===
[[File:Opening of the first parliament.jpg|thumb|300px|A painting of the opening of the first [[Parliament of Australia]], 9 May 1901, painted by [[Tom Roberts]]. Australia has had democracy since the 1850s.]]

Until 1901, Australia was not a [[nation]], it was six separate [[colony|colonies]] governed by Britain. They voted to join together to form one new country, called the Commonwealth of Australia, in 1901. Australia was still part of the [[British Empire]], and at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia. But soon it had its own money, and its own Army and Navy.

In Australia at this time, the [[trade union]]s were very strong, and they started a political party, the [[Australian Labor Party]]. Australia passed many laws to help the [[worker]]s.<ref>[http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/wright.htm Women and the Right to Vote in Australia - Australian Electoral Commission]</ref>

In 1914, the [[World War I|First World War]] started in Europe. Australia joined in on the side of Britain against [[Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Australian soldiers were sent to [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. They fought bravely, but were beaten by the Turks. Today Australia remembers this battle every year on [[ANZAC Day]]. They also fought on the [[Western Front]]. More than 60,000 Australians were killed.

Australia had a really hard time in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and joined Britain in a war against [[Nazi Germany]] when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore|Fall of Singapore]] by Japan. Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion. But with help from the [[United States Navy]], the Japanese were stopped. After the war, Australia became a close friend of the United States.

When the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work. So the government said it would take in people from Europe who had lost their homes in the war. It did things like building the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]]. Over the next 25 years, millions of people came to Australia. They came especially from [[Italy]] and [[Greece]], other countries in Europe. Later they also came from countries like [[Turkey]] and [[Lebanon]]. An important new party, the [[Liberal Party (Australia)|Liberal Party of Australia]] was made by [[Robert Menzies]] in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972, then [[Gough Whitlam]] won for the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]]. Whitlam made changes, but he made the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] unhappy and the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] sacked him and forced an election in 1975. Then [[Malcolm Fraser]] won a few elections for the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]].

In the 1960s many people began coming to Australia from [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]] and other countries in [[Asia]]. Australia became more [[multicultural]]. In the 1950s and 1960s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world, helped by mining and wool. Australia started trading more with America, then Japan. Australia supported the United States in wars against [[dictatorship]]s in [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] and later [[Iraq]]. Australian soldiers also helped the [[United Nations]] in countries like [[East Timor]] in 1999.

In 1973, the famous [[Sydney Opera House]] opened. In the 1970s, 80s and 90s lots of [[Australian cinema|Australian movies]], actors and [[Australian music|singers]] became famous around the world. In the year 2000, [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney had the Summer Olympics]].

In the 1980s and 90s, the Labor Party under [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]], then the Liberal Party under [[John Howard]] made lots of changes to the economy. Australia had a bad [[recession]] in 1991, but when other Western countries [[Global financial crisis of September–October 2008|had trouble with their economies in 2008]], Australia stayed strong.

Today Australia is a rich, peaceful and democratic country. But it still has problems. Around 4-5% of Australians could not get a job in 2010. A lot of land in Australia (like [[Uluru]]) has been returned to Aboriginal people, but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else. Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as [[immigrant]]s to live in  Australia. These people may come because they want to do business, or to live in a democracy, to join their family, or because they are [[refugee]]s. Australia took 6.5 million immigrants in the 60 years after [[World War Two]], including around 660,000 refugees.<ref>[http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html Australia in Brief: Australia - an overview - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]</ref>

[[Julia Gillard]] became the first woman [[Prime Minister of Australia]] in 2010 when she replaced her colleague [[Kevin Rudd]] of the Labor Party.

== Politics ==
[[File:Australian house of representatives04.jpg|thumb|left|The chamber of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] in [[Canberra]].]]

Australia is made up of six [[state]]s and three mainland [[wikt:territory|territories]]. Each state and territory has its own [[Parliament]] and makes its own local [[law]]s. The [[Parliament of Australia]] sits in Canberra and makes laws for the whole country, also known as the Commonwealth or [[Federation]].

The [[Federation|Federal]] government is led by the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], who is the member of Parliament chosen as leader. The current Prime Minister is [[Malcolm Turnbull]].

The leader of Australia is the Prime Minister, although the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] represents the Queen of Australia, who is also the Queen of Great Britain, as head of state. The Governor-General, currently [[His Excellency]] [[Peter Cosgrove|Sir Peter Cosgrove]], is chosen by the Prime Minister.

Australia was [[Colonisation|colonised]] by people from [[Britain]],<ref>{{cite book|title=A New History of Australia |authors=Takao Fujikawa |year=2004 |publisher=ARMA |location=Tokyo |page=pp. 40 }}</ref> but today people from all over the world live there. English is the main spoken language, and Christianity is the main religion, though all religions are accepted and not everybody has a religion. Australia is [[multiculturalism|multicultural]], which means that all its people are encouraged to keep their different languages, religions and ways of life, while also learning [[English language|English]] and joining in with other Australians.

Famous [[Australian literature|Australian writers]] include the bush balladeers [[Banjo Paterson]] and [[Henry Lawson]] who wrote about life in the Australian bush. More modern famous writers include [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]], [[Thomas Keneally]] and [[Colleen McCullough]]. In 1973, [[Patrick White]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], the only Australian to have achieved this; he is seen as one of the great English-language writers of the twentieth century.

[[Australian music]] has had lots of world-wide stars, for example the opera singers [[Nellie Melba]] and [[Joan Sutherland]], the rock and roll bands [[Bee Gees]], [[AC/DC]] and [[INXS]], the folk-rocker [[Paul Kelly (musician)]], the pop singer [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[Australian country music]] stars [[Slim Dusty]] and John Williamson. [[Australian Aboriginal music]] is very special and very ancient: it has the famous [[digeridoo]] woodwind instrument. [[File:didgeridoo.jpg|thumb|[[didgeridoo]]]]

Australian TV has produced many successful programs for home and overseas - including [[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo]], [[Home and Away]] and [[Neighbours]] - and produced such well known TV stars as [[Barry Humphries]] (''Dame Edna Everage''), [[Steve Irwin]] (''The Crocodile Hunter'') and [[The Wiggles]]. Major Australian subgroups such as the Bogan have been shown on Australian TV in shows such as [[Bogan Hunters]] and [[Kath & Kim]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/our-fascination-with-bogans-will-be-televised-25262 |title="Our fascination with "Bogans" will be televised" |publisher=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |last=Smith |first=Michelle |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref>

Australia has two public broadcasters (the ABC and the multi-cultural SBS), three commercial television networks, three pay-TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has its daily newspapers, and there are two national daily newspapers, ''[[The Australian]]'' and ''[[The Australian Financial Review]]''.

[[Australian cinema|Australian movies]] have a very long history.

=== Sport ===
[[File:DonaldBradman.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Don Bradman]].]]

Sport is an important part of Australian culture because the climate is good for outdoor activities. 23.5% Australians over the age of 15 regularly take part in organised sporting activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ndca.asn.au/other-information/about-australia/|title=About Australia|publisher=NDCA|accessdate=2013-06-18}}</ref> In international sports, Australia has very strong teams in [[cricket]], [[hockey]], [[netball]], [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]], and performs well in [[cycling]], [[rowing]] and [[swimming]]. Local popular sports include [[Australian Rules Football]], horse racing, soccer and motor racing. Australia has participated in every summer [[Olympic Games]] since 1896, and every [[Commonwealth Games]]. Australia has hosted the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics]], and has ranked in the top five medal-winners since 2000. Australia has also hosted the 1938, 1962, 1982 and 2006 [[Commonwealth Games]] and are to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games. Other major international events held regularly in Australia include the [[Australian Open]], one of the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tennis tournaments, annual international cricket matches and the [[Formula One]] [[Australian Grand Prix]]. Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and elite athletes is common in Australia. Televised sport is popular; some of the highest-rated television programs include the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and the grand finals of local and international football competitions.

The main sporting leagues for males are the [[Australian Football League]], [[National Rugby League]], [[A-League]] and [[National Basketball League (Australasia)|NBL]].
For women, they are [[ANZ Netball Championships]], [[W-League (Australia)|W-League]] and [[WNBL]].

Famous Australian [[sports]] players include the [[cricket]]er Sir [[Donald Bradman]], the [[swimming|swimmer]] [[Ian Thorpe]] and the [[Sportsperson|athlete]] [[Cathy Freeman]].

=== Art festivals ===

Just 60 years ago, Australia had only one big art festival. Now Australia has hundreds of smaller community-based festivals, and national and regional festivals that focus on specific art forms.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/arts_festivals.html | title=Art festivals | author=Australian government | accessdate=15 November 2010}}</ref>

== Wildlife ==
Australia is home to many animals that can be found nowhere else on Earth, which include: the [[koala]], the [[kangaroo]], the [[wombat]], the [[numbat]], the [[emu]], among many others. Most of the [[Marsupial|marsupials]] in the world are found only on the continent.[[File:Numbat.jpg|thumb|[[Numbat]]]]

[[Category:English-speaking countries]]'''American English''' or '''United States English''' is the [[dialect]] of [[English language]] spoken in the [[United States|United States of America]]. It is different in some ways from other types of English, such as [[British English]]. Many types of American English came from local dialects in England.

Many people today know about American English even if they live in a country where another sort of English is spoken. This may be because people hear and read American English through the [[mass media|media]], for example [[CNN]] television, and the [[Internet]], where the most common form of English is American English.

Because people all over the world use American English as well as other types of English, the English language gets new words. Because of this, English has been changing for hundreds of years. For example, the English language spoken in [[India]], which has more than one billion people, keeps adding more American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words from any of the 200+ Indian languages.

Sometimes people learn American English as it is spoken in America. For example, in telephone call centers in India and other places, people often learn American English to sound more like their customers who call from America. These people often keep using American English in everyday life.

The meaning of many words are different in American English. Most changes in a language start with small things. For example, [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[French language|French]] all came from [[Latin]].

==Spelling in American English==
There are many words that sound the same in both American English and British English, but are spelled differently.  For example:

*Words originally from French that end in "-our" in British English (behaviour, colour, honour, neighbour, etc.) end in "-or" in American English (behavior, color, honor, neighbor). 
<br/>Words of that come from French that end in -re in British English (metre, centre) end in -er in American English. In these cases [[Canadian]] usage is to keep the British (and French) spelling.
*Verbs that end in -ise in British English (criticise, realise) end in -ize in American English (criticize, organize, realize). However, the -ize ending is optional in British English, and is shown as an option in British dictionaries.
*One of the changes introduced by Noah Webster is the change of the double "l" from words like "travelled" to "traveled". 

Books show that many of these differences come from the writings of English-lover [[Noah Webster]], who made the American dictionary following the [[American War of Independence]].

Some more differences in American English:
* aluminium is spelled "aluminum"
* doughnut is spelled "donut"
* draught is spelled "draft"
* gaol (not common) is spelled "jail"
* plough is spelled "plow"

There are also some words in American English that are a bit different from British English, e.g.:
* aeroplane is called "airplane"
* ladybird is called "ladybug"
* lift is called "elevator"
* toilet is called "bathroom", "restroom" or "comfort station"
* lorry is called "truck"
* nappies are called "diapers"
* petrol is called "gas" (or "gasoline")
* the boot of a car is called a "trunk"
* a dummy is called a "pacifier"
* trousers are called "pants"
* underground is called "subway"
* football is called "soccer"
* braces are "suspenders" ("suspenders" in British-English are a type of clothing worn around the lower leg by males to stop socks/sox from sagging, and around the upper leg by women wearing stockings)

'''Aquaculture''' is the [[farming]] of [[fish]], [[shrimp]], and [[algae]], and other seafood.  Aquaculture supplies fish, such as [[catfish]], [[salmon]], and [[trout]]. Aquaculture was developed a long time ago in [[China]] and aquaculture supplies over 20% of all the seafood harvested. 

Aquaculture is quite a new activity in [[Canada]] as it only began in [[1879]].

[[Category:Water]]An '''abbreviation''' is a shorter way to write a word or phrase. People use abbreviations for words that they write a lot. The [[English language]] occasionally uses the [[apostrophe]] mark ' to show that a word is written in a shorter way, but some abbreviations do not use this mark. More often, they use [[Period (punctuation)|periods]], especially the ones that come from the [[Latin]] language. Common Latin abbreviations include '''i.e.''' [id est] ''that is'', '''e.g.''' [exempli gratia] ''for example'', and '''et al.''' [et alia] ''and others''.

Some new abbreviations have been created by [[scientist]]s, by workers in companies and governments, and by people using the [[Internet]].

People often think words are abbreviations when in fact they are [[acronym]]s.

Here are examples of common acronyms: The word "[[radar]]" is an [[acronym]] for "Radio Detection and Ranging". The name of the large computer company [[IBM]] comes from the words "International Business Machines". The name of the part of the [[United States]] government that sends [[rocket]]s into [[outer space]] is NASA, from the words "National Aeronautics and Space Administration". When people using the Internet think that something is very funny, they sometimes write "LOL" to mean "Laughing Out Loud". People sometimes write "ASAP" for "As Soon As Possible".

[[File:Angelsatmamre-trinity-rublev-1410.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Three angels, in a picture made in about 1420 by the Russian, Andrej Rublev.]]

In many mythologies and [[religion]]s, an '''angel''' is a good [[spirit]]. The word angel comes from the Greek word ''angelos'' which means "messenger". Angels appear frequently in the [[Old Testament]], the [[New Testament]], [[Qur'an]] and [[Aqdas]].

==In the Bible==
Angels are powerful, smart spirits that obey God's commands and praise him with singing and they have [[male]] ([[masculine]])[[gender]], but without any sex.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|26:53}}</ref> They sometimes appear to [[human]]s in human form.<ref>{{bibleverse||Hebrews|13:2}}</ref> They can deliver messages to people in person or in [[dream]]s.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|1:20}}</ref> Angels that are named in the [[Bible]] are [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] (called a "chief prince"<ref>{{bibleverse||Daniel|10}}</ref>), [[Gabriel]] (known for telling [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] that she would be the mother of [[Jesus]]<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|1:26-38}}</ref>), and Raphael (in the [[Apocrypha]]l [[Book of Tobit]]).<ref name=ABF>{{cite book|title=The Amazing Bible Factbook|year=2008|publisher=American Bible Society|location=New York|isbn=1603207783|pages=4-7, 179}}</ref>  The [[Ethiopia]]n [[Book of Enoch]] also lists four Archangels which watch over the four quadrants of heaven; Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Uriel. Lucifer is also known as an angel in the Bible.

===Types===
*'''Cherubim''' (plural of cherub) are described as "winged creatures" which have four wings<ref>{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|1:6}}</ref> Cherubim guard the [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] with a [[sword]] of fire.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|3:24}}</ref> This suggests that the author of Genesis was aware of different types of angels. Genesis 3:24 is found in the [[Book of Ezekiel]]. A Cherub is mentioned in Ezekiel 28:13-14, saying that the angel was in the Garden of God.<ref>The IVP New Bible Commentary pp734 states: ' the exact significance of the cherub is unclear'</ref>

Ezekiel 28:13-14
13. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.
14. Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

It describes the sound of their wings, "like the roar of rushing waters."<ref>{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|1:24}}</ref>

Ezekiel 10:5-7 ; Ezekiel 10:8 reveals that they have hands like a man under their wings .

Ezekiel 1:7 KJV reveals that they look like man but are different because they have "straight feet" and four wings and four faces.

Ezekiel ch 1, and 10 describe the cherubim creatures ascending and descending from the earth with wheels. Ezekiel 1:14-20 ; Ezekiel 10:16

Ezekiel 10:9-13 describes what the wheels appeared to look like, and how they moved around, how they moved or flew through the sky quickly but turned not as they went; and how the inside workings of the wheels appeared to be "a wheel in the midst of a wheel" and that the color of the wheels was the color of "Amber" Stone. There are four separate wheels in both accounts, one for each single cherub which is there.

*'''Seraphim''' (plural of seraph, which means "burning")they also are depicted having wings, six of them. They are known for singing and praising God. They can shout so loud, they shake the [[temple]].<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|6:4}}</ref>
*'''Archangels''' like Gabriel ([[Gospel of Luke]] 1:19) are the highest type of angel. They are considered [[saint]]s in the [[Catholic church]].<ref name=ABF/> However, in the King James Version of the Bible; they are another type of angel. In the [[Book of Revelation]] the Angel Michael casts the 'great dragon' [[Satan]] out of heaven and down to earth in a great battle between the good and bad angels, just before the Great Judgement of angels and man. (Revelation 12)
*The [[Leviathan]] in [[Book of Job]] 41:19-21 has flame that goes:  'out of his mouth' like a [[dragon]].  Isaiah 30:6 also talks of a 'fiery flying serpent'. Compare Revelation 20:2: , where an angel: 'laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the [[Devil]], and Satan, and bound him a thousand years'.

==In art==
They are often shown in art as having wings and a [[halo]]. The wings represent their speed, and the halo represents their holiness.

The cherubim in art always appear as baby faced angels with very small non useful wings.

The cherubim statue or [[bronze]] casting of cherubim in the Temple of [[Solomon]] depicted them as two four winged creatures whose wings touched at the peak of the ark that they were making.

The same cherubim creatures were said to be cast in gold on top of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. Casting metal is one of the oldest forms of artwork, and was attempted by [[Leonardo Da Vinci]].

==Angelology==
The study of Angels is called Angelology.<ref>[http://www.theology.edu/theology/angel.htm Angelology]</ref>

[[Category:Theology]]'''Ad hominem''' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] word for a type of [[argument]]. It is a word often used in [[rhetoric]]. Rhetoric is the science of speaking well, and convincing other people of your [[idea]]s.

Translated to English, ''ad hominem'' means ''against the person''. In other words, when someone makes an ad hominem, they are [[attack]]ing the person they are arguing against, instead of what they are saying.

The term comes from the Latin word ''homo'', which means [[human]]. ''Hominem'' is a [[gender]] neutral version of the word ''homo''. In ancient [[Rome]] it referred to all free men, or in other words, all free human beings.

Ad hominem can be a way to use [[reputation]], [[rumor]]s and [[hearsay]] to change the minds of other people listening. When a [[social network]] has already excluded or exiled one person, or applied a negative [[label]] to them, this can work more often.

It is most of the time considered to be a weak and poor argument. In [[court]]s and in [[diplomacy]] ad hominems are not appreciated.

Ad hominems are not wrong every time. For example, when people think that someone can't be [[Trust (social sciences)|trusted]], things that they have said previously can be [[doubt]]ed.

== What an ad hominem argument looks like ==
In [[logic]], a [[wikt:proof|proof]] is something that starts with [[premise]]s, and goes through a few logical [[argument]]s, to reach a [[conclusion]].

=== Normal (valid) proof ===
# All [[human]]s are mortal
# [[Socrates]] is a man (he is human)
# Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

=== Ad hominem example ===
# Person A thinks [[abortion]] should be [[illegal]]
# Person A is uneducated and poor
# Therefore, abortion should not be illegal.

In this example it can be seen that the (completely unrelated) fact that person A is uneducated and poor is used to prove that abortion should not be illegal.

[[Category:Latin words used in English]][[File:Edward S. Curtis Collection People 013.jpg|right|200px|A picture of a Native American]]
'''Native Americans''' (also called '''Aboriginal Americans''', '''American Indians''', '''Amerindians''', or '''Indigenous Peoples of America''') are the people, and their descendants, who were in [[North America]], [[Central America]], [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean]] Islands when Europeans arrived. There are many different [[tribe]]s of Native American people, with many different languages. There are more than three million Native Americans in Canada and the U.S. combined. Approximately 51 million Native Americans live in [[Latin America]].

Sometimes these people are called "Indians", but this is confusing, because it is the same word used for people from [[India]]. When [[Christopher Columbus]] was travelling [[West]], he did not know about the [[Americas]]. He thought he was going to [[India]], so he called the people "Indians". 

Many Native Americans died after the Europeans came to the Americas, from [[disease]]s that came with the Europeans that were new to the Native Americans, in [[battle]] with the Europeans, or because the Europeans made them work as [[slave]]s. Most of the these native people were hurt or killed by settlers who took their lands.

The ancestors of Native Americans came to the Americas from [[Asia]]. Some of them may have come to America over 12,000 years ago when [[Alaska]] was connected to [[Siberia]] by the [[Bering land bridge]].

Some Native American tribes of North America are [[Cherokee]], [[Maya people|Maya]] or [[Yucatec]], [[Aztecs]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], and [[Sioux]]. 

Some Native American tribes of South America are [[Aymara people|Aymara]], [[Guaraní people|Guarani]], [[Quechua]], and [[Tupi]].

[[tr:Kızılderililer]]The '''apple tree''' (''[[Malus]] domestica'') is a deciduous tree in the [[Rosaceae|rose family]] best known for its sweet, pomaceous fruit, the '''apple'''. It is cultivated worldwide as a fruit tree, and is the most widely grown species in the genus ''Malus.'' The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, ''Malus sieversii'', is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions.

Apple trees are large if grown from seed, but small if grafted onto roots (rootstock). There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples, resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw and cider production. Apples are generally propagated by grafting, although wild apples grow readily from seed. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.

Worldwide production of apples in 2013 was 80.8 million tonnes, with China accounting for 49% of the total.<ref name="faostat">{{cite web|url=http://faostat3.fao.org/browse/Q/QC/E|publisher= FAOSTAT, UN Food & Agriculture Organization, Statistics Division|title=Production/Crops, Apple, Area by World|date=2013|accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref>

== Botanical information ==

The apple has a small, leaf-shedding tree that grows up to 30 to 12metres (9.8 to 39ft) tall. The apple tree has a broad crown with thick [[twig]]s.
The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[Phyllotaxis|alternately arranged]] simple [[oval]]s. They are 5 to 12[[centimeter|centimetres]] long and 3–6centimetres (1.2–2.4in) wide. It has a sharp top with a soft underside. [[Blossom]]s come out in [[spring]] at the same time that the leaves begin to bud. The [[flower]]s are white. They also have a slightly pink color. They are five [[petal]]ed, and 2.5 to 3.5centimetres (0.98 to 1.4in) in [[wikt:diameter|diameter]]. The fruit [[wikt:maturity|matures]] in [[autumn]]. It is usually 5 to 9centimetres (2.0 to 3.5in) in diameter. There are five [[carpel]]s arranged in a [[star]] in the middle of the fruit. Every carpel has one to three [[seed]]s.
[[Image:95apple.jpeg|thumb|left|Wild ''Malus sieversii'' apple in [[Kazakhstan]]]]

=== Wild ancestors ===
The wild [[ancestor]] of apple trees is ''[[Malus sieversii]]''. They grow wild in the [[mountain]]s of [[Central Asia]] in the north of [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Xinjiang]], [[People's Republic of China|China]],<ref name="Architecture and size relations: an essay on the apple (Malus x domestica, Rosaceae) tree"/> and possibly also ''Malus sylvestris''.<ref name="Coart"/> Unlike [[wikt:domestication|domesticated]] apples, their leaves become red in autumn.<ref>Archetti M.

PMID 19369261</ref> They are being used recently to develop ''Malus domestica'' to grow in colder [[wikt:climate|climates]].<ref name="app3"/>

==History==

The apple tree was possibly the earliest tree to be cultivated.<ref name=app6/> Its fruits have become better over thousands of years. It is said that [[Alexander the Great]] discovered [[wikt:small|dwarf]] apples in [[Asia Minor]] in 300 [[BC]]. [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] have used winter apples as an important food for thousands of years. From when [[Europe]]ans arrived, [[Argentina]] and the [[United States]] have used apples as food as well.<ref name=app6>{{cite web

== In culture ==
=== Paganism ===
[[Image:Carl Larsson Brita as Iduna.jpg|thumb|"Brita as [[Iðunn|Iduna]]" (1901) by Carl Larsson]]

In [[Norse mythology]], the goddess [[Iðunn]] gives apples to the gods in ''[[Prose Edda]]'' (written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]) that makes them young forever. English [[wikt:scholar|scholar]] H. R. Ellis Davidson suggests that apples were related to [[religion|religious]] practices in [[Germanic paganism]]. It was from there, she claims, that [[Norse paganism]] developed. She points out that buckets of apples were discovered in the place of burial for the Oseberg [[ship]] in [[Norway]]. She also remarks that fruit and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]] (Iðunn having been described as changing into a nut in ''Skáldskaparmál'') have been discovered in the early [[grave]]s of the [[Germanic peoples]] in [[England]]. They have also been discovered somewhere else on the continent of Europe. She suggests that this may have had a [[symbol]]ic meaning. Nuts are still a symbol of [[fertility]] in Southwest England.

== Cooking ==
Sometimes apples are eaten after they are [[cooked]]. Often apples are eaten uncooked. Apples can also be made into [[drink]]s. [[Apple juice]] and apple [[cider]] are apple drinks. 

The flesh of the fruit is firm with a taste anywhere from sour to sweet. Apples used for cooking are sour, and need to be cooked with sugar, while other apples are sweet, and do not need cooking. There are some seeds at the core, that can be removed with a [[tool]] that removes the core, or by carefully using a [[knife]].

The [[scientific name]] of the apple tree genus in the [[Latin]] language is ''Malus''. Most apples that people grow are of the ''Malus domestica'' species.

Most apples are good to eat [[raw]] (not cooked), and are also used in many kinds of [[bake]]d foods, such as [[apple pie]]. Apples are cooked until they are [[wikt:soft|soft]] to make [[apple sauce]].

Apples are also made into the [[drink]]s [[apple juice]] and [[cider]]. Usually, cider contains a little [[alcohol]], about as much as [[beer]]. The regions of [[Brittany]] in [[France]] and [[Cornwall]] in [[England]] are known for their apple ciders.

== Apple cultivars ==
If one wants to grow a certain type of apple it is not possible to do this by planting a seed from the wanted type. The seed will have [[DNA]] from the apple that the seeds came from, but it will also  have DNA from the apple flower that [[pollinate]]d the seeds, which may well be a different type. This means that the tree which would grow from planting would be a mixture of two. In order to grow a certain type of apple, a small twig, or 'scion', is cut from the tree that grows the type of apple desired, and then added on to a specially grown [[stump]] called a rootstock. The tree that grows will only create apples of the type needed.

There are more than 7,500 known [[cultivar]]s of apples.<ref name="Elzebroek">{{cite book|last=Elzebroek|first=A.T.G.|coauthors=Wind, K.|title=Guide to Cultivated Plants|publisher=CAB International|location=Wallingford|date=2008|page=27|isbn=1845933567|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YvU1XnUVxFQC&lpg=PT39&dq=apple%20cultivars%207%2C500&pg=PT39#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}</ref> Different cultivars are available for [[temperate]] and [[subtropical]] climates.

== In the United Kingdom ==
In the [[United Kingdom]] there are about 3000 different types of apples. The most common apple type grown in England is the 'Bramley seedling', which is a popular cooking apple.

Apple orchards are not as common as they were in the early 1900s, when apples were rarely brought in from other countries. Organizations such as [http://www.commonground.org.uk/ Common Ground] teach people about the importance of rare and local varieties of fruit. '[[Apple Day]]' is celebrated each [[October 21]] in many countries.

== In North America ==
Many apples are grown in [[temperate]] parts of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. In many areas where apple growing is important, people have huge celebrations:

* [[Annapolis Valley Apple Blossom Festival]] - held five days every spring (May-June) in [[Nova Scotia]]
* [[Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival]] - held six days every spring in [[Winchester, Virginia]].
* [[Washington State Apple Blossom Festival]] - held two weeks every spring (April-May) in [[Wenatchee, Washington]]

== Varieties of apples ==
[[File:Golden delicious apple.jpg|right|thumb|A Golden Delicious apple.]]
There are lots of different varieties of apples, including:

* [[Fuji (apple)]]
* [[Gala]]
* [[Golden Delicious]] (sometimes called a Green Delicious Apple)
* [[Granny Smith]]
* [[Jonagold]]
* [[McIntosh]]
* [[Pink Lady]]
* [[Red Delicious]]
* [[Winesap]]
* [[Cox's Orange Pippin]]

== Family ==
Apples are in the group [[Maloideae]]. It is a subfamily of the family ''[[Rosaceae]]''. They are in the same subfamily as [[pear]]s. Its family is the family of rose like plants, and roses are in the family.

An '''Abrahamic religion''' is a [[religion]] whose people believe that the Hebrew patriarch [[Abraham]] and his descendants hold an important role in human spiritual development. The best known Abrahamic religions are [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. Smaller religious traditions occasionally listed among the larger Abrahamic religions include: [[Samaritanism]], [[Druze]], [[Rastafari]], [[Mandaeism]], and [[Babism]].

Abrahamic religions are "[[monotheism|monotheistic]]", meaning that they believe in just one God. They also all believe that people should [[pray]] to and [[worship]] this God often. The Abrahamic Religions are the world's most common monotheistic religions.

[[Category:Babism]]'''Algebra''' is a part of [[mathematics]] (often called ''math'' in the [[United States]] and '''maths''' in the [[United Kingdom]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Math or Maths|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Mathematics.html|publisher=Wolfram.com|accessdate=11 April 2013}}</ref> ). It uses [[variable]]s to represent a value that is not yet known.  When an equals sign (=) is used, this is called an [[equation]].  A very simple equation using a variable is: <tt>2 + 3 = x</tt>   In this example, <tt>x = 5</tt>, or it could also be said, "x is five".  This is called ''solving for x''.  <ref>{{cite web|title=Algebra Introduction|url=http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/introduction.html|publisher=Math Is Fun|accessdate=11 April 2013}}</ref>

Besides equations, there are [[inequality|inequalities]] (''less than'' and ''greater than''). A special type of equation is called the function.  This is often used in making [[graph]]s.

Algebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things.  [[Physics]], [[engineering]] and [[computer programming]] are areas that use algebra all the time.  It is also useful to know in [[surveying]], [[construction]] and [[business]], especially [[accounting]].

People who do algebra need to know the rules of [[number]]s and mathematic [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] used on numbers, starting with [[addition|adding]], [[subtraction|subtracting]], [[multiplication|multiplying]], and [[division (mathematics)|dividing]].  More advanced operations involve [[exponent]]s, starting with [[square (algebra)|squares]] and [[square root]]s. Many of these rules can also be used on the variables, and this is where it starts to get interesting.

Algebra was first used to solve [[algebraic equation|equations]] and inequalities. Two examples are [[linear equation]]s (the equation of a line, <tt>y=mx+b</tt>) and [[quadratic equation]]s, which has variables that are squared (power of two, a number that is multiplied by itself, for example: <tt>2*2, 3*3, x*x</tt>).  How to [[factorization|factor]] [[polynomial]]s is needed for quadratic equations.

== History ==
Early forms of algebra were developed by the [[Babylonian]]s and the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However the word "algebra" is a [[Latin language|Latin]] form of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''Al-Jabr'' ("casting") and comes from a mathematics book ''Al-Maqala fi Hisab-al Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah'', ("Essay on the Computation of Casting and Equation") written in the [[9th century]] by a famous [[Iran|Persian]] mathematician, [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]], who was a [[Islam|Muslim]] born in [[Khwarizm]] in [[Uzbekistan]]. He flourished under Al-Ma'moun in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] through 813-833 AD, and died around 840 AD. The book was brought into [[Europe]] and [[translation|translated]] into Latin in the [[12th century]]. The book was then given the name 'Algebra'. (The ending of the mathematician's name, al-Khwarizmi, was changed into a word easier to say in Latin, and became the English word ''[[algorithm]]''.)<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Algebra|url=http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~sxw8045/history.htm|publisher=UCS Louisiana|accessdate=11 April 2013}}</ref> 

==Examples==

Here is a simple example of an algebra problem:

:Sue has 12 candies, Ann has 24 candies. They decide to share so that they have the same number of candies. 

These are the steps you can use to solve the problem:

# To have the same number of candies, Ann has to give some to Sue.  Let ''x'' represent the number of candies Ann gives to Sue. 
# Sue's candies, plus ''x'', must be the same as Ann's candies minus ''x''.  This is written as: <tt>12 + x = 24 - x</tt> 
# Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation. This gives: <tt>x = 12 - x</tt>.  (What happens on one side of the equals sign must happen on the other side too, for the equation to still be true. So in this case when 12 was subtracted from both sides, there was a middle step of <tt>12 + x - 12 = 24 - x - 12</tt>.  After a person is comfortable with this, the middle step is not written down.)
# Add ''x'' to both sides of the equation. This gives: <tt>2x = 12</tt>
# Divide both sides of the equation by 2. This gives <tt>x = 6</tt>. The answer is six.  If Ann gives Sue 6 candies, they will have the same number of candies.
# To check this, put 6 back into the original equation wherever ''x'' was: <tt>12 + 6 = 24 - 6</tt>
# This gives <tt>18=18</tt>, which is true.  They both now have 18 candies.

With practice, algebra can be used when faced with a problem that is too hard to solve any other way. Problems such as building a freeway, designing a cell phone, or finding the cure for a disease all require algebra.

== Writing algebra ==
As in most parts of mathematics, adding ''z'' to ''y'' (or ''y'' plus ''z'') is written as <tt>y + z</tt>.
Subtracting ''z'' from ''y'' (or ''y'' minus ''z'') is written as <tt>y − z</tt>.
Dividing ''y'' by ''z'' (or ''y'' over ''z'': <math>y \\over z</math>) is written as <tt>y ÷ z</tt> or <tt>y/z</tt>. <tt>y/z</tt> is more commonly used.

In algebra, multiplying ''y'' by ''z'' (or ''y'' times ''z'') can be written in 4 ways: <tt>y × z</tt>, <tt>y * z</tt>, <tt>y·z</tt>, or just <tt>yz</tt>. The multiplication symbol "×" is usually not used, because it looks too much like the letter x, which is often used as a variable.  Also, when multiplying a larger expression, parentheses can be used: <tt>y (z+1)</tt>.

When we multiply a number and a letter in algebra, we write the number in front of the letter: <tt>5 × y = 5y</tt>. When the number is 1, then the 1 is not written because 1 times any number is that number (1 × ''y'' = ''y'') and so it is not needed.

== Functions and Graphs ==
[[File:Linear equation for y=3x+1.png|thumb|Linear equation for y=3x+1]]
An important part of algebra is the study of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], since functions often appear in equations that we are trying to solve. A function is like a box you can put a number or numbers into and get a certain number out. When using functions, [[graph]]s can be powerful tools in helping us to study the solutions to equations. 

A graph is a picture that shows all the values of the variables that make the equation or inequality true. Usually this is easy to make when there are only one or two variables. The graph is often a line, and if the line does not bend or go straight up-and-down it can be described by the basic formula <tt>y = mx + b</tt>. The variable ''b'' is the [[y-intercept]] of the graph (where the line crosses the vertical axis) and ''m'' is the [[mathematics|slope]] or steepness of the line. This formula applies to the [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinates]] of a graph, where each point on the line is written <tt>(x, y)</tt>.  

In some math problems like the equation for a line, there can be more than one variable (''x'' and ''y'' in this case).  To find points on the line, one variable is changed. The variable that is changed is called the "independent" variable.  Then the math is done to make a number. The number that is made is called the "dependent" variable. Most of the time the independent variable is written as ''x'' and the dependent variable is written as ''y'', for example, in <tt>y = 3x + 1</tt>.  This is often put on a graph, using an ''x'' axis (going left and right) and a ''y'' axis (going up and down).  It can also be written in function form: <tt>f(x) = 3x + 1</tt>.  So in this example, we could put in 5 for ''x'' and get <tt>y = 16</tt>.  Put in 2 for ''x'' would get <tt>y=7</tt>.  And 0 for ''x'' would get <tt>y=1</tt>.  So there would be a line going thru the points (5,16), (2,7), and (0,1) as seen in the graph to the right.

If x has a power of 1, it is a straight line.  If it is squared or some other power, it will be curved.  If it uses an inequality (''<'' or ''>''), then usually part of the graph is shaded, either above or below the line.

== Rules of algebra ==
In algebra, there are a few rules that can be used for further understanding of equations. These are called the rules of algebra. While these rules may seem senseless or obvious, it is wise to understand that these properties do not hold throughout all branches of mathematics. Therefore, it will be useful to know how these axiomatic rules are declared, before taking them for granted. Before going on to the rules, reflect on two definitions that will be given.
# Opposite - the opposite of <math>a</math> is <math>-a</math>.
# Reciprocal - the reciprocal of <math>a</math> is <math>\\frac{1}{a}</math>.

=== Rules ===

==== Commutative property of addition ====
'Commutative' means that a function has the same result if the numbers are swapped around. In other words, the order of the terms in an equation do not matter. When the operator of two terms is an addition, the 'commutative property of addition' is applicable. In algebraic terms, this gives <math>a + b = b + a</math>.

Note that this does not apply for subtraction! (i.e. <math>a - b \\ne b - a</math>)

==== Commutative property of multiplication ====
When the operator of two terms is an multiplication, the 'commutative property of multiplication' is applicable. In algebraic terms, this gives <math>a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a</math>.

Note that this does not apply for division! (i.e. <math>\\frac{a}{b} \\ne \\frac{b}{a}</math>, when <math>a \\neq b </math>)

==== Associative property of addition ====
'Associative' refers to the grouping of numbers. The associative property of addition implies that, when adding three or more terms, it doesn't matter how these terms are grouped. Algebraically, this gives <math>a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c</math>. Note that this does not hold for subtraction, e.g. <math>1 = 0 - (0 - 1) \\neq (0 - 0) - 1 = -1</math> (see the distributive property).

==== Associative property of multiplication ====
The associative property of multiplication implies that, when multiplying three or more terms, it doesn't matter how these terms are grouped. Algebraically, this gives <math>a \\cdot (b \\cdot c) = (a \\cdot b) \\cdot c</math>. Note that this does not hold for division, e.g. <math>2 = 1/(1/2) \\neq (1/1)/2 = 1/2</math>.

==== Distributive property ====
The distributive property states that the multiplication of a number by another term can be distributed. For instance: <math>a \\cdot (b + c) = ab + ac</math>. (Do ''not ''confuse this with the associative properties! For instance, <math>a \\cdot (b + c) \\ne (a \\cdot b) + c</math>.)

==== Additive identity property ====
'Identity' refers to the property of a number that it is equal to itself. In other words, there exists an operation of two numbers so that it equals the variable of the sum. The additive identity property states that the sum of any number and 0 is that number: <math>a + 0 = a</math>. This also holds for subtraction: <math>a - 0 = a</math>.

==== Multiplicative identity property ====
The multiplicative identity property states that the product of any number and 1 is that number: <math>a \\cdot 1 = a</math>. This also holds for division: <math>\\frac{a}{1} = a</math>.

==== Additive inverse property ====
The additive inverse property is somewhat like the opposite of the additive identity property. When an operation is the sum of a number and its opposite, and it equals 0, that operation is a valid algebraic operation. Algebraically, it states the following: <math>a - a = 0</math>. Additive inverse of 1 is (-1).

==== Multiplicative inverse property ====
The multiplicative inverse property entails that when an operation is the product of a number and its reciprocal, and it equals 1, that operation is a valid algebraic operation. Algebraically, it states the following: <math>\\frac{a}{a} = 1</math>. Multiplicative inverse of 2 is 1/2.

==Advanced Algebra==
In addition to "[[elementary algebra]]", or basic algebra, there are advanced forms of algebra, taught in colleges and universities, such as [[abstract algebra]], [[linear algebra]], and [[universal algebra]]. 
This includes how to use a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] to solve many linear equations at once. ''[[Abstract algebra]]'' is the study of things that are found in equations. For example, polynomials and matrices. These things are known as algebraic structures. Understanding the properties of more complex [[algebraic structure]]s can help us solve more complex equations.

Many math problems are about physics and engineering. In many of these physics problems time is a variable. Time uses the letter ''t''. Using the basic ideas in algebra can help reduce a math problem to its simplest form making it easier to solve difficult problems. Energy is ''e'', force is ''f'', mass is ''m'', acceleration is ''a'' and speed of light is sometimes ''c''.  This is used in some famous equations, like <tt>f = ma</tt> and <tt>e=mc^2</tt> (although more complex math beyond algebra was needed to come up with that last equation).

An '''atom''' is the basic unit that makes up all [[matter]]. There are many different types of atoms, each with its own name, [[mass]] and size. These different types of atoms are called [[chemical element]]s. The chemical elements are organized on the periodic table. Examples of elements are [[hydrogen]] and [[gold]]. Atoms are very small, but the exact size changes depending on the element. Atoms range from 0.1 to 0.5 [[nanometer]]s in width.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/MichaelPhillip.shtml|title=Size of an Atom}}</ref> One nanometer is around 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human [[hair]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/BrianLey.shtml|title=Diameter of a Human Hair}}</ref> This makes atoms impossible to see without special tools. [[Equation]]s must be used to see the way they work and how they interact with other atoms.

Atoms come together to make [[molecule]]s or particles: for example, two hydrogen atoms and one [[oxygen]] atom combine to make a [[water]] molecule, a form of a [[chemical]] reaction.

Atoms themselves are made up of three kinds of smaller particles, called [[proton]]s (which are positively charged), [[neutron]]s (which have no charge) and [[electron]]s (which are negatively charged). The protons and neutrons are in the middle of the atom. They are called the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. They are surrounded by a cloud of electrons which are attracted to the nucleus' positive charge.  This attraction is called [[electromagnetic]] force.

Protons and neutrons are made up of even smaller particles called [[quark]]s. Electrons are [[elementary particle|elementary or fundamental particles]]; they cannot be split into smaller parts.

The number of protons, neutrons and electrons an atom has determines what element it is. Hydrogen, for example, has one proton, no neutrons and one electron;  the element [[sulfur]] has 16 protons, 16 neutrons and 16 electrons.

Atoms move faster when in gas form (as they are free to move) than liquid and solid matter. In solid [[material]]s, the atoms are tightly next to each other so they [[vibration|vibrate]], but are not able to move (there is no room) as atoms in liquids do.

== History ==
The word "atom" comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] (ἀτόμος), ''[[wiktionary:indivisible|indivisible]]'', from (ἀ)-, ''not,'' and τόμος, ''a cut.'' The first historical mention of the word atom came from works by the Greek [[philosophy|philosopher]] Democritus, around 400 BC.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.winneconne.k12.wi.us/ms_teachers/LENZ/history_of_atomic_theory.htm|title=History of Atomic Theory}}</ref> Atomic theory stayed as a mostly [[philosophy|philosophical]] subject, with not much actual scientific investigation or study, until the development of [[chemistry]] in the 1650s.

In 1777 [[France|French]] chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] defined the term ''element'' for the first time. He said that an [[chemical element|element]] was any basic substance that could not be broken down into other substances by the methods of chemistry. Any substance that could be broken down was a ''[[Chemical compound|compound]]''.<ref name=Brief>{{citeweb|url=http://www.cerritos.edu/ladkins/a106/a%20brief%20history%20of%20the%20atom.htm|title=A Brief History of the Atom}}</ref>

In 1803, [[England|English]] philosopher [[John Dalton]] suggested that elements were tiny, solid spheres made of atoms. Dalton believed that all atoms of the same element have the same mass. He said that compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine. According to Dalton, in a compound, atoms of different elements always combine the same way.

In 1827, British scientist [[Robert Brown]] looked at [[pollen]] grains in water and used Dalton's atomic theory to describe patterns in the way they moved. This was called ''[[brownian motion]]''. In 1905 [[Albert Einstein]] used mathematics to prove that the seemingly random movements were down to the reactions of atoms, and by doing so he conclusively proved the existence of the atom.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_95/journal/vol4/ykl/report.html|title=Brownian motion - a history}}</ref>
In 1869 scientist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] published the first version of the [[periodic table]]. The periodic table groups atoms by their [[atomic number]] (how many [[proton]]s they have. This is usually the same as the number of [[electron]]s). 
Elements in the same column, or period, usually have similar properties. For example, [[helium]], [[neon]], [[argon]], [[krypton]] and [[xenon]] are all in the same column and have very similar properties. All these elements are [[gas]]es that have no colour and no smell. Together they are known as the [[noble gas]]es.<ref name=Brief />

The physicist [[J.J. Thomson]] was the first person to discover electrons. This happened while he was working with [[cathode ray]]s in 1897. He realized they had a negative [[electric charge|charge]], unlike protons (positive) and neutrons (no charge). Thomson created the [[plum pudding model]], which stated that an atom was like plum pudding: the dried fruit (electrons) were stuck in a mass of pudding (protons). In 1909, a scientist named [[Ernest Rutherford]] used the [[Geiger–Marsden experiment]] to prove that most of an atom is in a very small space called the [[atomic nucleus]]. Rutherford took a photo plate and surrounded it with gold foil, and then shot alpha particles at it. Many of the particles went through the gold foil, which proved that atoms are mostly empty space. Electrons are so small they make up only 1% of an atom's [[mass]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://ion.elte.hu/~akos/orak/atfsz/atom/rutherford_atom11.pdf|title=Ernest Rutherford on Nuclear spin and Alpha Particle interaction.}}</ref>

[[File:Ernest Rutherford LOC.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ernest Rutherford]]

In 1913, [[Niels Bohr]] introduced the [[Bohr model]]. This model showed that electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed circular orbits. This was more accurate than the Rutherford model. However, it was still not completely right. Improvements to the Bohr model have been made since it was first introduced.

In 1925, chemist [[Frederick Soddy]] found that some elements in the periodic table had more than one kind of atom.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1921/soddy-bio.html|title=Frederick Soddy, the Nobel Prize in chemistry: 1921}}</ref> 
For example, any atom with 2 protons should be a [[helium]] atom. Usually, a helium [[Nucleus (physics)|nucleus]] also contains two neutrons. However, some helium atoms have only one neutron. This means they are still helium, as the element is defined by the number of protons, but they are not normal helium either. Soddy called an atom like this, with a different number of neutrons, an ''[[isotope]]''. To get the name of the isotope we look at how many protons and neutrons it has in its [[Nucleus (physics)|nucleus]] and add this to the name of the element. So a helium atom with two protons and one neutron is called helium-3, and a carbon atom with six protons and six neutrons is called carbon-12. However, when he developed his theory Soddy could not be certain neutrons actually existed. To prove they were real, physicist James Chadwick and a team of others created the [[mass spectrometer]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1935/chadwick-lecture.html|title=James Chadwick: The Nobel Prize in Physics 1935, a lecture on the Neutron and its properties}}</ref> The mass spectrometer actually measures the mass and weight of individual atoms. By doing this Chadwick proved that to account for all the weight of the atom, neutrons must exist.

In 1937, [[Germany|German]] chemist [[Otto Hahn]] became the first person to create [[nuclear fission]] in a laboratory. He discovered this by chance when he was shooting neutrons at a [[uranium]] atom, hoping to create a new isotope.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/classroom/chemach/atomic/hahn-meitner.html|title=Otto Hahn, Liese Meitner and Fritz Strassman}}</ref> However, he noticed that instead of a new isotope the uranium simply changed into a [[barium]] atom. This was the world's first recorded nuclear fission reaction. This discovery eventually led to the creation of the [[atomic bomb]].

Further into the 20th century physicists went deeper into the mysteries of the atom. Using [[particle accelerator]]s they discovered that protons and neutrons were actually made of other particles, called [[quarks]].

The most accurate model so far comes from the [[Schrödinger equation]]. Schrödinger realized that the electrons exist in a cloud around the nucleus, called the [[electron cloud]]. In the electron cloud, it is impossible to know exactly where electrons are. The Schrödinger equation is used to find out where an electron is likely to be. This area is called the electron's [[atomic orbital|orbital]].

The complex atom is made up of three main particles; the [[proton]], the [[neutron]] and the [[electron]]. The [[isotope]] of [[Hydrogen]] Hydrogen-1 has no neutrons, and a positive hydrogen [[ion]] has no electrons. These are the only known exceptions, all other atoms have at least one proton, neutron and electron each.

Electrons are by far the smallest of the three, their mass and size is too small to be measured using current technology.<ref name=park>{{citeweb|url=http://sciencepark.etacude.com/particle/structure.php|title=Particle Physics - Structure of a Matter}}</ref> They have a negative [[Electric charge|charge]]. Protons and neutrons are of similar size to each other,<ref name=park/> protons are positively charged and neutrons have no charge. 
Most atoms have a neutral charge; because the number of protons (positive) and electrons (negative) are the same, the charges balance out to zero. However, in [[ion]]s (different number of electrons) this is not always the case and they can have a positive or a negative charge. Protons and neutrons are made out of [[quark]]s, of two types; up quarks and down quarks. A proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark and a neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark.

=== Nucleus ===
The nucleus is in the middle of an atom. It is made up of protons and neutrons. Usually in nature, two things with the same charge repel or shoot away from each other. So for a long time it was a mystery to scientists how the positively charged protons in the nucleus stayed together. They solved this by finding a particle called a ''[[gluon]]''. Its name comes from the word ''[[glue]]'' as gluons act like atomic glue, sticking the protons together using the ''strong nuclear force''. It is this force which also holds the quarks together that make up the protons and neutrons.

[[File:Nuclear fusion forces diagram.svg|thumb|left|250px|A diagram showing the main difficulty in [[nuclear fusion]], the fact that protons, which have positive charges, repel each other when forced together.]]

The number of neutrons in relation to protons defines whether the nucleus is stable or goes through [[radioactive decay]]. When there are too many neutrons or protons, the atom tries to make the numbers the same by getting rid of the extra particles. It does this by emitting radiation in the form of [[alpha particle|alpha]], [[beta particle|beta]] or [[gamma ray|gamma]] decay.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/quantskills/methods/quantlit/RadDecay.html|title=How does radioactive decay work?}}</ref> Nuclei can change through other means too. [[Nuclear fission]] is when the nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei, releasing a lot of stored [[energy]]. This release energy is what makes nuclear fission useful for making [[bomb]]s and [[electricity]], in the form of [[nuclear power]]. 
The other way nuclei can change is through [[nuclear fusion]], when two nuclei join together, or fuse, to make a heavier nucleus. This process requires extreme amounts of energy in order to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the protons, as they have the same charge. Such high energies are most common in [[star]]s like our [[Sun]], which fuses hydrogen for fuel.

=== Electrons ===
{{main|Electron}}

Electrons  orbit or go around the nucleus. They are called the atom's ''electron cloud''. They are attracted towards the nucleus because of the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic force]]. Electrons have a negative charge and the nucleus always has a positive charge, so they attract each other. 
Around the nucleus some electrons are further out than others. These are called ''electron shells''. In most atoms the first shell has two electrons, and all after that have eight. Exceptions are rare, but they do happen and are difficult to predict.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.chemtutor.com/struct.htm#str|title=Chemtutor on atomic structure}}</ref> The further away the electron is from the nucleus, the weaker the pull of the nucleus on it. This is why bigger atoms, with more electrons, react more easily with other atoms.
The electromagnetism of the nucleus is not enough to hold onto their electrons and they lose them to the strong attraction of smaller atoms.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.sciencebyjones.com/chemical_reactivity.htm|title=Chemical reactivity}}</ref>

== Radioactive decay ==
{{main|Radioactive decay}}

Some elements, and many isotopes, have what is named an ''unstable nucleus''. This means the nucleus is either too big to hold itself together<ref name=Splung>{{citeweb|url=http://www.splung.com/content/sid/5/page/radioactivity|title=Radioactivity}}</ref> or has too many protons, electrons or neutrons. When this happens the nucleus has to get rid of the excess mass or particles. It does this through [[radiation]]. An atom that does this can be called ''radioactive''. Unstable atoms continue to be radioactive until they lose enough mass/particles that they become stable. All atoms above atomic number 82 (82 protons) are radioactive.<ref name=Splung />

There are three main types of radioactive decay; [[alpha decay|alpha]], [[beta decay|beta]] and [[gamma ray|gamma]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.s-cool.co.uk/gcse/physics/radioactivity/types-of-radiation.html|title=S-Cool: Types of radiation}}</ref>

* [[Alpha decay]] is when the atom shoots out a particle having two protons and two neutrons. This is essentially a [[helium]] nucleus. The result is an element with atomic number two less than before. So for example if a [[beryllium]] atom (atomic number 4) went through alpha decay it would become helium (atomic number 2). Alpha decay happens when an atom is too big and needs to get rid of some mass.
* [[Beta decay]] is when a neutron turns into a proton or a proton turns into a neutron. In the first case the atom shoots out an electron. In the second case it is a [[positron]] (like an electron but with a positive charge). The end result is an element with one higher or one lower atomic number than before. Beta decay happens when an atom has either too many protons, or too many neutrons.
* [[Gamma ray|Gamma decay]] is when an atom shoots out a [[gamma ray]], or wave.  It happens when there is a change in the [[energy]] of the nucleus. This is usually after a nucleus has already gone through alpha or beta decay. There is no change in the mass, or atomic number or the atom, only in the stored energy inside the nucleus.

Every radioactive element or isotope has what is named a ''[[half-life (element)|half-life]]''. This is how long it takes half of any sample of atoms of that type to decay until they become a different stable isotope or element.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/isotopes/radioactive_decay3.html|title=What is half-life?}}</ref> Large atoms, or isotopes with a big difference between the number of protons and neutrons will therefore have a long half life.

Ernest Rutherford was the first to discover two of the three types of ionising radiation, alpha and beta particles, being emitted from the natural isotope radium. When he put radium in a light bulb to watch it decay, suddenly helium (which consists of 2 protons and 2 neurons) appeared inside the glass bulb .

[[Marie Curie]] discovered the first form of radiation.  She found the element and named it radium. She was also the first female recipient of the [[Nobel Prize]].

Frederick Soddy conducted an experiment to observe what happens as radium decays. He placed a sample in a light bulb and waited for it to decay. Suddenly helium (containing 2 protons and 2 neutrons) appeared in the bulb, and from this experiment he discovered this type of radiation has a positive charge.

James Chadwick discovered the neutron, by observing decay products of different types of radioactive isotopes. Chadwick noticed that the atomic number of the elements was lower than the total atomic mass of the atom. He concluded that electrons would not of had contributed to the atomic mass because they barely have mass.

[[Enrico Fermi]], used the neutrons to shoot them at uranium. He discovered that uranium decayed a lot faster than usual and produced a lot of alpha and beta particles. He also believed that uranium transmutated into a new element he named [[hesperium]].

[[Otto Hanh]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] repeated Fermi's experiment to see if the new element hesperium was actually created. They discovered two new things Fermi did not observe. By using a lot of neutrons the nucleus of the atom would split the nucleus producing a lot of heat energy. Also the fission products of [[uranium]] were already discovered: [[thorium]], [[palladium]], [[radium]], [[radon]] and [[lead]].

Fermi then noticed that the fission of one uranium atom let off more neutrons which then split other atoms creating chain reactions. He realised that this process is called nuclear fission and could create crazy amounts of heat energy.

That very discovery of Fermi's lead to the development of the first nuclear bomb code-named 'Trinity'.

Nuclear energy is harnessed to create electricity and soon becomes the most popular way to generate energy.

[[Category:Nuclear physics]][[File:Atlas Coelestis-1.jpg|thumb|280px|18th century map of the sky]]

'''Astronomy''' is a [[natural science]]. It is the study of everything outside the
[[atmosphere of Earth]].

It studies [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] (such as [[star]]s, [[Galaxy|galaxies]], [[planet]]s, [[natural satellite|moon]]s,  [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s and [[nebula]]e) and processes (such as [[supernova|supernovae explosions]], [[gamma ray burst]]s, and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]). This includes the [[physics]], [[chemistry]] of those objects and processes.

A related subject, [[physical cosmology]], is concerned with studying the [[Universe]] as a whole,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Unsöld|first1=Albrecht|last2=Baschek|first2=Bodo|title=Classical Astronomy and the Solar System - Introduction|date=2001|pages=1}}</ref> and the way the universe changed over time.

The word astronomy comes from the Greek words ''astron'' which means [[star]] and ''nomos'' which means [[law]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=astronomy|title=Astronomy - and etymology|accessdate=2008-11-9}}</ref> A person who studies astronomy is called an '''astronomer'''.

Astronomy is one of the oldest [[science]]s. Ancient people used the positions of the stars to navigate, and to find when was the best time to plant [[crops]]. Astronomy is very similar to [[astrophysics]]. Since the 20th century there have been two main types of astronomy, ''observational'' and ''theoretical'' astronomy. Observational astronomy uses [[telescope]]s and [[camera]]s to ''[[wikt:observe|observe]]'' or look at stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects. Theoretical astronomy uses [[maths]] and [[computer model]]s to predict what should happen. The two often work together, the theoretical predicts what should happen and the observational shows whether the prediction works. 

Astronomy is not the same as ''[[astrology]]'', the belief that the patterns the stars and the planets may affect [[human]] lives. 

== History of astronomy ==
{{main|History of astronomy}}
=== Ancient ===
Early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars. They used [[map]]s of the [[constellation]]s and stars for religious reasons and also to work out the time of year.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=17322&pageno=5|title=An online book - Gutenberg history of Astronomy}}</ref> Early civilisations such as the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] people and the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians built simple [[observatory|observatories]] and drew maps of the stars positions. They also began to think about the place of [[Earth]] in the [[universe]]. For a long time people thought [[Earth]] was the center of the universe, and that the planets, the stars and the sun went around it. This is known as the ''geocentric'' model of [[the Universe]].

[[Ancient Greeks]] tried to explain the motions of the sun and stars by taking measurements.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| last = Krafft| first = Fritz| year = 2009| title = Astronomy| editor-last = Cancik| editor-first = Hubert| editor2-last = Schneider| editor2-first = Helmuth| encyclopedia = [[Brill's New Pauly]]}}</ref> A mathematician named [[Eratosthenes]] was the first who measured the size of the Earth and proved that the Earth is a [[sphere]]. A theory by another mathematician named [[Aristarchus]] was, that the sun is in the center and the Earth is moving around it. This is known as the ''Heliocentric'' model. Only a small group of people thought it was right. The rest continued to believe in the ''geocentric'' model.

Most of the names of constellations and stars that we have, come from Greeks of that time.<ref>Thurston, H., ''Early Astronomy.'' Springer, 1994. p.2</ref> 

Arabic astronomers made many advancements during the [[Middle Ages]] including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the Earth.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/1612/medieval.html|title=A brief history of Astronomy}}</ref>

=== Renaissance to modern era ===
[[File:Galileo moon phases.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawings of [[the Moon]] by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]. His drawings were more detailed than anyone before him because he used a telescope to look at the Moon.]]
During the [[renaissance]] a priest named [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] thought, from looking at the way the planets moved, that the Earth was not the center of everything. Based on previous works, he said that the Earth was a [[planet]] and all the planets moved around the sun.  This ''[[heliocentrism]]'' was an old idea.  A physicist called [[Galileo Galilei]] built his own [[telescope]]s, and used them to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time.  He agreed with Copernicus.  Their ideas were also improved by [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton]] who invented the [[wikt:theory|theory]] of [[gravity]]. At this time the [[Catholic Church]] decided that Galileo was wrong.  He had to spend the rest of his life under [[house arrest]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/bio/narrative_7.html|title=Galileo Project - Galileo and the inquisition}}</ref>

After Galileo, people made better telescopes and used them to see farther objects such as the planets [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]. They also saw how stars were similar to our Sun, but in a range of colours and sizes. They also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as [[Galaxy|galaxies]] and [[nebula]]e.

=== Modern era ===  
The 20th century saw important changes in astronomy.

In 1931, Karl Jansky discovered radio emission from outside the Earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications, marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] to observe the sky. Those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy, allowing more discoveries to be made.

The opening of this new window on the [[Universe]] saw the discovery of entirely new things, for example [[pulsar]]s, which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space. The waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that it implied an artificial source.

The period after [[World War 2]] saw more [[observatory|observatories]] where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good observing sites, normally by governments.  For example, [[Bernard Lovell]] began radio astronomy at Jodrell Bank using leftover military [[radar]] equipment.  By 1957, the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world. Similarly, the end of the 1960s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at [[Mauna Kea]] in [[Hawaii]], a good site for visible and infra-red telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies.  Mauna Kea would eventually come to host very large and very accurate telescopes like the Keck Observatory with its 10-meter mirror.  

The next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry.  This allowed telescopes to be placed in space on [[satellite (artificial)|satellites]].

Satellite-based telescopes opened up the Universe to human eyes. Turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere blurs images taken by ground-based telescopes, an effect known as seeing.  It is this effect that makes stars "twinkle" in the sky.  As a result, the pictures taken by satellite telescopes in visible light (for example, by the Hubble Space Telescope) are much clearer than Earth-based telescopes, even though Earth-based telescopes are very large.

[[Space observatory|Space telescopes]] gave access, for the first time in history, to the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]] including rays that had been blocked by the atmosphere.  The [[X-ray]]s, [[gamma ray]]s, [[ultraviolet]] light and parts of the [[infra-red]] spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched.  As with other parts of the spectrum, new discoveries were made.

From 1970s satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites, causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

== Discoveries ==
Discoveries broadly come in two types:  bodies and phenomena.  Bodies are things in the Universe, whether it is a planet like our Earth or a galaxy like our Milky Way.  Phenomena are events and happenings in the Universe.  

=== Bodies ===
For convenience, this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found: those found around stars are solar bodies, those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else larger are cosmic bodies.

==== Solar ====
* [[Planet]]s
* [[Asteroid]]s
* [[Comet]]s

==== Galactic ====
*[[Star]]s

Diffuse Objects:
* [[Nebula]]s
* Clusters

Compact Stars:
* [[White dwarf|White dwarves]]
* [[Neutron star]]s
* [[Black hole]]s

==== Cosmic ====
* [[Galaxy|Galaxies]]
* [[Galaxy cluster]]s
* [[Supercluster]]s

=== Phenomena ===
Burst events are those where there is a sudden change in the heavens that disappears quickly.  These are called bursts because they are normally associated with large explosions producing a "burst" of energy.  They include: 
* [[Supernova]]s
* [[Nova]]s

Periodic events are those that happen regularly in a repetitive way.  The name periodic comes from period, which is the length of time required for a [[Wave (physics)|wave]] to complete one cycle.  Periodic phenomena include: 
* [[Pulsar]]s
* [[Variable star]]s

Noise phenomena tend to relate to things that happened a long time ago.  The signal from these events bounce around the Universe until it seems to come from everywhere and varies little in intensity.  In this way, it resembles "noise", the background signal that pervades every instrument used for astronomy.  The most common example of noise is static seen on analogue televisions.  The principal astronomical example is: [[Cosmic background radiation]].

== Methods ==
=== Instruments ===
* [[Telescopes]] are the main tool of observing. They take all the light in a big area and put in into a small area. This is like making your eyes very big and powerful. Astronomers use telescopes to look at things that are far away and dim. Telescopes make objects look bigger, closer, brighter. 
* [[Spectrometer]]s study the different [[wavelength]]s of light. This shows what something is made of. 
* Many telescopes are in satellites. They are [[space observatory|space observatories]]. 

=== Techniques ===
There are way  astronomers can get better pictures of the heavens.  Light from a distant source reaches a [[sensor]] and gets measured, normally by a human eye or a camera.  For very dim sources, there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen.  One technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using ''integration'', (which is like longer exposures in [[photography]]).

==== Integration ====
Astronomical sources do not move much: only the rotation and movement of the Earth causes them to move across the heavens. As light particles reach the camera over time, they hit the same place making it brighter and more visible than the background, until it can be seen.  

Telescopes at most observatories (and satellite instruments) can normally track a source as it moves across the heavens, making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures.  Also, images can be taken on different nights so exposures span hours, days or even months. In the digital era, digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by [[computer]], which overlays the images after correcting for movement.

==== Aperture synthesis ====
With [[radio telescope]]s smaller telescopes can be combined together to create a big one, which works like one as big as the distance between the two smaller telescopes.

==== Adaptive optics ====
[[Adaptive optics]] means changing the shape of the mirror or lens while looking at something, to see it better.

=== Data analysis ===
Data analysis is the process of getting more information out of an astronomical observation than by simply looking at it. The observation is first stored as data.  This data will then have various techniques used to [[analysis|analyse]] it.

==== Fourier analysis ====
[[Fourier analysis]] in mathematics can show if an observation (over a length of time) is changing periodically (changes like a wave).  If so, it can extract the frequencies and the type of wave pattern, and find many things including new planets.

== Fields ==
A good example of a fields comes from [[pulsar]]s which pulse regularly in [[radio waves]].  These turned out to be similar to some (but not all) of a type of bright source in X-rays called a Low-mass X-ray binary.  It turned out that all pulsars and some LMXBs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found. Those LMXBs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes.

This section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy, their period of importance and the terms used to describe them. It should be noted that astronomy in the Modern Era has been divided mainly by electromagnetic spectrum, although there is some evidence this is changing.

=== Fields by body ===
==== Solar astronomy ====
{{main|Sun}}

Solar astronomy is the study of the [[Sun]]. The Sun is the closest star to Earth at around 92 million (92,000,000) miles away.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF1/142.html|title=Sun/Earth distance, article #144|accessdate=2009-3-9}}</ref> It is the easiest to observe in detail. Observing the Sun can help us understand how other stars work and are formed. Changes in the Sun can affect the weather and climate on Earth. A stream of charged [[particle]]s called the [[Solar wind]] is constantly sent off from the Sun. The Solar Wind hitting the Earth's [[magnetic field]] causes the [[Aurora|northern lights]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Isun.html|title=The Solar Wind and the Van Allen radiation belts}}</ref> Studying the Sun helped people understand how [[nuclear fusion]] works.

==== Planetary astronomy ====
Planetary Astronomy is the study of [[planet]]s, [[Satellite (natural)|moons]], [[dwarf planet]]s, [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s as well as other small objects that orbit stars. The planets of our own [[Solar System]] have been studied in depth by many visiting [[spacecraft]] such as [[Cassini-Huygens]] ([[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]) and the [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2|2]].

==== Galactic astronomy ====
Galactic Astronomy is the study of distant [[galaxy|galaxies]].  Studying distant galaxies is the best way of learning about our own galaxy, as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make it difficult to observe.  Galactic Astronomers attempt to understand the structure of galaxies and how they are formed through the use of different types of telescopes and computer simulations.

=== Fields by electromagnetic spectrum ===
==== Radio astronomy ====
*[[Radio telescope]]

==== Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) ====
Hydrodynamics is used in astronomy for [[mathematical model|mathematically modelling]] how gases behave. Strong [[magnetic field]]s found around many bodies can drastically change how these gases behave, affecting things from star formation to the flows of gases around compact stars. This makes MHD an important and useful tool in astronomy.

=== Other fields ===
==== Gravitational wave astronomy ====
Gravitational wave astronomy is the study of the [[Universe]] in the gravitational wave spectrum.  So far, all astronomy that has been done has used the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].  Gravitational Waves are ripples in [[spacetime]] emitted by very dense objects changing shape, which include [[White dwarf|white dwarves]], [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s.  Because no one has been able to detect gravitational waves directly, the impact of Gravitational Wave Astronomy has been very limited.

'''Architecture''' is the [[science]] of the [[design]] of [[structure]]s or [[building]]s such as houses, places of worship, and office buildings.  Architecture is also the [[profession]] of an [[architect]]. A person must [[wikt:study|study]] at an [[institution]] of [[higher education]] (university) to become an [[architect]].<ref>

</ref> Architecture can be about small designs, such as a [[garage]], or large designs, such as a whole [[city]]. Architecture often overlaps with [[civil engineering]], and architects and civil engineers often work together.

== History ==
[[File:Saint Leonardo vault.PNG|thumb|Romanesque groin vault]]
In the past, people built [[wikt:hut|hut]]s and wood [[house]]s to protect themselves from the weather. For safety, they were often close together. Great [[civilization]]s like the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians built large [[temples]] and structures, like the [[Great Pyramids of Giza]]. The [[Ancient Greek]]s and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s made what we now call [[Classical Architecture|"Classical Architecture"]]. The Romans, working over 2000 years ago, copied the [[arch]] from the [[Etruscans]], who copied it from the [[Mesopotamia]]ns. The [[stone]] [[column]]s, which still hold up so many important buildings, like the [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens]], were simply copied from the first wooden posts.

[[File:Former post office in Nemti.jpg|thumb|A simpler building, in [[Hungary]]]]
'''Classical Architecture''' was very formal, and it always obeyed [[laws]]. It used [[symmetry]], which really means [[wikt:simple:balance|balance]], and it used [[proportion]] which means keeping shapes in certain ways. The [[Golden ratio|Golden Mean]] was a rule (or law) which said, (to put it very simply) if you are making a room, or any other thing, it will work best if you always make the long side 1.6 times longer than the short side. There are many laws in Classical Architecture, like how high the middle of an arched [[bridge]] needs to be (which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be). These laws were learned from thousands of [[year]]s of experience and they are as true today as they were 2000 years ago.

In some parts of the world, like [[India]], the architecture is famous for [[carving]] the stone on temples and palaces. Different architectural styles were made in [[China]], [[Japan]], Southeast Asia, [[Africa]], [[Mexico]], and Central and [[South America]].

Later, people in [[Western Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]] made [[Romanesque architecture]], then [[Gothic architecture]].  Gothic buildings have tall, pointed [[window]]s and arches.  Many [[church]]es have Gothic architecture. [[Castle]]s were also built at this time. In [[Eastern Europe]], churches usually had [[dome]]s. People added their own ideas and [[decoration]] to the Classical Architecture of the past.  The [[Renaissance]] brought a return to classical ideas. 
[[File:NYC - Guggenheim Museum.jpg|thumb|left|There can be many different kinds of styles to architecture, such as the curved dome on the [[Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York City]]]]
In the late 18th century with the [[Industrial Revolution]], people began to [[invent]] machines to make things quickly and cheaply. Many [[factory|factories]] and [[Mill (factory)|mills]] were built during, or after this revolution. Decades later, in the [[Victorian era]], architects like [[George Fowler Jones]] and [[Decimus Burton]] still followed the Gothic style to build new churches. Up to this point, buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and [[masonry]] used to construct them. Gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller. For example, the cathedral in [[Ulm]], Germany is over 500 feet tall. However, building with stone has its limits, and building too tall could result in collapse, an example of which is the [[Beauvais Cathedral]], which was never completed. 
[[File:Sears Tower ss.jpg|thumb|New technology allows new kinds of buildings such as for the [[Willis Tower]] in [[Chicago]]]]

Towards the end of the 19th Century with a second Industrial Revolution, [[steel]] became much cheaper. Architects began to use inventions like metal girders and [[reinforced concrete]] to build. An example is the [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]]. Buildings can now be built taller than ever before. We call them [[skyscrapers]]. This new [[technology]] has made us free from traditional limitations, and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials, many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated, replaced, or abandoned. Cheap, strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls, especially for office buildings.

[[Modernism]] is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies, and its beginnings can been seen as early as 1890. Modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late 20th century, and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then, which are sometimes called "post-modern".

Many of the world's greatest structures were built by modern-day architects such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[I. M. Pei]], [[Adrian Smith (architect)|Adrian Smith]], [[Edward Durell Stone]], [[Fazlur Khan]], and [[Bruce Graham]].

[[Category:Construction]][[File:Lateral head anatomy detail.jpg|thumb|Anatomy of the human head]]
'''Anatomy''' is the [[research|study]] of the [[body|bodies]] of living beings.  This can be [[human|people]], [[animal]]s, or [[plant]]s. It is like taking the body apart, and looking at its parts ([[organ (anatomy)|organs]], [[muscle]]s and [[bone]]s). People who study ''anatomy'' then look where a certain organ (or bone, or muscle) should be, or where it normally is.

The history of anatomy dates back to 1600 BCE when [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] began studying human anatomy. They discovered the functions of many organs like the liver, spleen, kidneys, heart etc. and were the first to discover the structure and functions of the lymphatic system.

[[Academic]] human anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.

==Body Systems==

There are different systems, such as the cardiovascular system, also known as the [[circulatory system]] (the system that gets [[blood]] around the body), the muscular system (the system that contains [[muscle]]s), the [[nervous system]] (the system that controls the [[nerve]]s,and the brain) and the [[skeleton]] (the bones). 

Human anatomy, [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]] are similar basic medical sciences.

[[Category:Anatomy| ]][[File:(253)_mathilde_crop.jpg|thumb|A photo of asteroid (253) Mathilde taken by [[NEAR]]]]
An '''asteroid''' is a small object in the Solar System that travels around the [[Sun]]. It is like a [[planet]] but smaller. They range from less than 1 km (over 1000 feet) to 600 miles (1000 km) across. A few asteroids have [[asteroid moon]]s.

The name "asteroid" means "like a star" in the ancient [[Greek language]]. Asteroids may look like small stars in the sky, but they really do move around the [[Sun]], while stars only seem to move because the [[Earth]] spins. Like planets, asteroids do not make their own [[light]]. Because of this, some people think "asteroids" is not a good name, and think that the name "planetoid" ("like a planet") would be a better name.

Giuseppe Piazzi found the first asteroid, in 1801. It was named [[1 Ceres]], and is the biggest object in the [[asteroid belt]]. Other asteroids in the asteroid belt, like [[3 Juno|Juno]], [[2 Pallas]], and [[4 Vesta]] were found later. Today, astronomers using computerized [[telescope]]s find thousands of asteroids every month.  

Asteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the [[Solar System]]. These rocks were too small to make a planet, and could not collide but  some are made of [[carbon]] or [[metal]]. Depending on what's on the surface, they are classified into various kinds in including Type M (metal), Type S (stone), and Type C (carbon).

Most asteroids in our [[Solar System]] are in the [[asteroid belt]] between [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] and [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. Many are not in the main asteroid belt. The ones that come close to Earth are called [[Near-Earth asteroid]]s. Many scientists think asteroids striking the Earth killed off [[K/T extinction event|all the dinosaurs]] and caused some of the other [[extinction event]]s.

In early times people passed through it with animals and other goods as it connected China and India with [[Central Asia]] and the Middle East. More recently, Afghanistan has been damaged by many years of war and there not being enough jobs.

The country is around 251,826 square [[miles]] (652,230 square kilometers) in size or area. There are 30 million people in Afghanistan. There are about 3 million Afghan [[refugees]] (people who had to leave the country) who are in Pakistan and Iran for some time. [[Kabul]], its capital, had about 3,691,400 people living in it in 2011.<ref name="cso.gov.af">http://cso.gov.af/Content/files/2-2.pdf</ref>

== Land and climate ==
[[File:Black Hawk flying over a valley in Bamyan.jpg|left|thumb|Snow-capped Koh-i-Baba mountains in [[Bamyan Province]] of Afghanistan.]]
Afghanistan has many [[mountains]]. The mountains are called the [[Hindu Kush]] and [[Himalayas]]. The big mountain in Afghanistan is [[Noshaq|Mount Nowshak]]. There are [[plains]] (which have soil that is good for growing plants) and [[foothills]]. Part is also dry and called the [[Registan Desert]].

Afghanistan has snow and [[glaciers]] in the mountains. [[Amu Darya]] is the big water stream, or river.

Afghanistan is dry and cold in winter and hot in summer. Having no water sometimes causes problems for [[farmers]]. [[Sandstorms]] happen a lot in the [[desert]].<ref>"Afghanistan." Britannica Student Library. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.</ref>

The country has a lot of a [[valuable]] [[stone]] called [[lapis lazuli]], which was used to decorate the [[tomb]] of the [[Egypt]]ian king [[Tutankhamun]].<ref name=ngk>{{cite web |url=http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/places/find/afghanistan/ |title=Afghanistan Facts and Pictures |work=National Geographic Kids |accessdate=30 August 2011}}</ref>

== Plants and animals ==
[[File:Uncia uncia 2.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Endangered [[snow leopard]]s live in the cold [[Hindu Kush]], but they have thick [[fur]] to stay warm. Hunters sell the soft leopard skins in the markets in the capital [[Kabul]].]]
[[South]]ern Afghanistan has not many plants because it is dry. There are more plants where there is more water. Mountains have [[forests]] of [[pine]] and [[fir]]. [[cedar]], [[oak]], [[walnut]], [[alder]], and [[ash tree]]s.

Afghanistan's animals are in the mountains. There are [[wolves]], [[foxes]], [[jackals]], [[bears]], and wild [[goat]]s, [[gazelle]]s, wild dogs, [[camel]]s, and [[wild cat]]s such as the [[snow leopard]] in the country. The birds are [[falcon]]s, [[eagles]] and [[vulture]]s. The [[Rhesus Macaque]] and the red flying [[squirrel]] are also in Afghanistan.

Many years of [[war]], [[hunting]], and years of no water have killed animals in Afghanistan. There used to be [[tigers]] in Afghanistan, but now there aren't any. Bears and wolves are almost gone.<ref name=ngk/>

== People and culture ==
[[File:2011 Afghan Youth Voices Festival.jpg|thumb|left|The 2011 Afghan Youth Voices Festival at the Gardens of Babur in [[Kabul]]]]

Many different cultures have moved through or invaded the land of Afghanistan. Today the people of Afghanistan, known as ''Afghans'', have many traits passed down from these groups. The largest [[ethnic group]] (group of people considered the same in some or multiple ways) is the [[Pashtuns]] (or ethnic Afghans), who make up about half the Afghan people.<ref>See:

Afghanistan is a largely [[rural]] country, which means that there are only few major cities and much spaced-apart land. Only about one fifth of the population lives in cities. [[Kabul]], the capital, is the largest city. It is along the [[Kabul River]] south of the [[Hindu Kush]] range. Other cities in Afghanistan include [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], [[Mazar-e Sharif]], and [[Jalalabad]]. The rural population is made up of [[farmer]]s and [[nomad]]s (people who move or travel from place to place). The farmers live mainly in small villages along the rivers. The nomads live in tents while moving from place to place with their animals and belongings. Some Afghan people live in the high central mountains or the deserts in the south and southwest. Millions of people escaped from Afghanistan in order to not get involved in the wars that happened in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Most of them lived in neighboring [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]].

== History ==
Afghanistan is in the [[Trail|path]] of important trade routes that connect southern and eastern [[Asia]] to [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]]. Because of this, many empire builders have decided to rule over the area. Signs that these emperors were near Afghanistan still exist in many parts of the country.<ref>[Encyclopedia Britannica, Afghanistan History. Retrieved on 26 January 2009 http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan/129450/History#ref=ref261360]</ref> Afghanistan is near what used to be the [[Silk Road]], so it has many cultures. From up to 8,000 years ago, the peoples of Afghanistan helped develop (create) major world religions, traded and exchanged many [[product (business)|products]], and sometimes controlled politics and culture in Asia.<ref>Hiebert, F., Cambon, P., 2008, AFGHANISTAN Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul, page 56, Washington, National Geographic, ISBN 978-1-4262-0295-7</ref>

=== Prehistory ===
[[File:Raffael 071.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Zoroaster]], the founder of [[Zoroastrianism]], lived in [[Bactria]], an ancient land in the north of today's Afghanistan.]]
[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] digging a cave in what is now northeastern Afghanistan (in [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]]), discovered that people lived in the country as early as 100,000 years ago. They found the skull of a [[Neanderthal]], or early human, as well as tools from about 30,000 years ago. In other parts of Afghanistan, archaeologists uncovered [[pottery]] and tools that are 4,000 to 11,000 years old—evidence that Afghans were among the first people in the world to grow crops and raise animals.<ref name="ReferenceA">"Afghanistan." Britannica Elementary Library. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica.</ref> 
[[File:Kaunakes Bactria Louvre AO31917.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A Stone Female Figurine, known as '''Bactrian Princess''', from [[Bactria]], north of Afghanistan, about 4,000 years ago]]

Farmers and herders settled in the plains surrounding the [[Hindu Kush]] as early as 7000 B.C. These people may have grown rich off the [[lapis lazuli]] they found along riverbeds, which they traded to early city sites to the west, across the [[Iranian plateau]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. As farms and villages grew and thrived in Afghanistan, these ancient people eventually invented [[irrigation]] (digging ditches for water so it flows to crops) that allowed them to grow crops on the northern Afghanistan desert plains. This [[civilization]] (advanced state of organization) is today called BMAC ([[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex]]), or the "Oxus civilization".<ref>Hiebert, F., Cambon, P., 2008, AFGHANISTAN Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul, page 58, Washington, National Geographic, ISBN 978-1-4262-0295-7</ref>

The Oxus civilization expanded as far east as western edge of the [[Indus Valley]] during the period between 2200 and 1800 B.C.<ref>Hiebert, F., Cambon, P., 2008, AFGHANISTAN Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul, page 73, Washington, National Geographic, ISBN 978-1-4262-0295-7</ref> These people, who were the ancestors of the Indo-Aryans, used the term "[[Aryan]]" to identify their ethnicity, culture, and religion. Scholars know this when they read the ancient texts of these people; the [[Avesta (religious scripture)|Avesta]] of Iranian people and the [[Vedas]] of Indo-Aryans.<ref>[R. Ghirshman, L’Iran et la migration des Indo-aryens et des Iraniens, Leiden, 1977.]</ref><ref>[Encyclopedia Iranica, IRANIAN IDENTITY ii. PRE-ISLAMIC PERIOD. Retrieved on 14 October 2010 http://www.iranica.com/articles/iranian-identity-ii-pre-islamic-period]</ref>

According to the Avesta, Aryans settled in sixteen districts in the area, beginning with ''Airiana vaejo'' (land of Aryans), and following with Bāxδī = Bactria or [[Balkh]]; Nisāya = a district between Margiana and Bactria; Harōiva = Areia or [[Herat|Herāt]]; Vaēkərəta = Gandhāra; Urvā = [[Ghazni Province|Ghazni]] region; Haraxᵛaitī = Arachosia or [[Kandahar]]; Haētumant = [[Helmand Province|Helmand]] region; Raγa = a district north of Haraxᵛaitī and Haētumant; Čaxra = Čarx between Ghazni and Kabul, in the valley of Logar.<ref>[Encyclopedia Iranica, AVESTAN GEOGRAPHY.

[[Zoroaster]], the founder of the [[Zoroastrian]] religion, the world's earliest [[monotheistic]] religion, (meaning a religion believing in one god) lived in the area (somewhere north of today's Afghanistan), around 1000 B.C.<ref>[http://www.iranica.com/articles/zoroaster-ii-general-survey Encyclopaedia Iranica: ZOROASTER ii. GENERAL SURVEY. By W. W. Malandra] In the Avesta, the geography of the Vendīdād and of the Yashts make it clear that these texts locate themselves in eastern [ancient] Iran [today's Afghanistan]. Even though there are later traditions which place him in Azerbaijan and Media, it is more reasonable to locate Zoroaster somewhere in today's Afghanistan along with the rest of the Avesta. Further, the two Avestan dialects belong linguistically to eastern [ancient] Iran [today's Afghanistan]</ref>

=== Ancient history ===
[[File:Ancient Khorasan highlighted.jpg|thumb|Names of territories during the [[Caliphate]] in 750 CE. [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] was part of Persia (in [[yellow]]ish).]]
By the middle of the sixth century BC, the [[Achaemenids]] took over control of the land, which was previously held by the [[Medes]], and made it part of the [[Persian empire]]. [[Alexander the great]] defeated and conquered the Persian Empire in 330 BC. He founded some cities in the area and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture and language continued to influence the people for a long period, right up to the [[Islamic conquest]] in the 7th century A.D. After Alexander, [[Greco-Bactrians]], [[Scythians]], [[Kushans]], [[Parthians]] and [[Sassanians]] ruled the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/851961/ancient-Iran |title=ancient Iran |work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=30 August 2011}}</ref>

Kushans spread [[Buddhism]] from [[India]] in the 1st century B.C., and Buddhism remained an important religion in the area until the 7th century.<ref>[Encyclopedia Iranica, BUDDHISM i. In Pre-Islamic Times. Retrieved on 12 September 2010 http://iranica.com/articles/buddhism-i]</ref> The [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] were the remainder of Buddhism in Afghanistan. Those giant statues were destroyed by the very religious [[Taliban]] in 2001, despite international protests in defence of the priceless art. The Taliban believed that those ancient statues were [[Islam|un-Islamic]] and a curse on Afghanistan.

=== Medieval history ===

[[Arabs]] introduced [[Islam]] in the 7th century and slowly began spreading the new religion. In the 9th and 10th centuries, many local Islamic dynasties rose to power inside Afghanistan. One of the earliest was the [[Tahirids]], whose kingdom included [[Balkh]] and [[Herat]]; they established independence from the [[Abbasids]] in 820. The Tahirids were succeeded in about 867 by the [[Saffarids]] of [[Zaranj]] in western Afghanistan. Local princes in the north soon became [[wikt:feudatory|feudatories]] of the powerful [[Samanids]], who ruled from [[Bukhara]]. From 872 to 999, north of the Hindu Kush in Afghanistan enjoyed a golden age under Samanid rule.<ref>"Afghanistan." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.</ref>

In the 10th century, the local [[Ghaznavid Empire|Ghaznavids]] turned [[Ghazni]] into their capital and firmly established Islam throughout all areas of Afghanistan, except the Kafiristan region in the northeast. [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], a great Ghaznavid [[sultan]], conquered the [[Multan]] and [[Punjab region]], and carried raids into the heart of [[India]]. Mohammed bin Abdul Jabbar Utbi (Al-Utbi), a historian from the 10th century, wrote that thousands of "Afghans" were in the Ghaznavid army.<ref name="Houtsma">{{Cite book|title=E.J.

All the major cities of modern Afghanistan were centers of science and culture in the past. The New Persian [[literature]] arose and flourished in the area. The early Persian poets such as [[Rudaki]] were from what is now Afghanistan. Moreover, [[Ferdowsi]], the author of [[Shahnameh]], the national [[Epic poetry|epic]] of Iran, and [[Rumi]], the famous [[Sufi]] poet, were also from modern-day Afghanistan. It has produced scientists such as [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Farabi]], [[Al-Biruni]], [[Omar Khayyám]], [[Al-Khwarizmi]], and many others who are widely known for their important contributions in areas such as [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[medicine]], [[physics]], [[geography]], and [[geology]]. It remained the cultural capital of Persia until the devastating [[Mongol]] invasion in the 13th century.<ref>Lorentz, J. Historical Dictionary of Iran. 1995 ISBN 0-8108-2994-0 AFGHANISTAN</ref>

[[Timur]], the Turkic conqueror, took over in the end of the 14th century and began to rebuild cities in this region. Timur's successors, the [[Timurids]] (1405–1507), were great patrons of learning and the arts who enriched their capital city of Herat with fine buildings. Under their rule Afghanistan enjoyed peace and prosperity.

Between south of the Hindu Kush and the Indus River (today's Pakistan) was the native land of the Afghan tribes. They called this land "Afghanistan" (meaning "land of the Afghans"). The Afghans ruled the rich northern Indian subcontinent with their capital at [[Delhi]]. From the 16th to the early 18th century, Afghanistan was disputed between the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] of [[Isfahan]] and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] of [[Agra]] who had replaced the [[Lodi dynasty|Lodi]] and [[Sur Empire|Suri]] Afghan rulers in India. The Safavids and Mughals occasionally oppressed the native Afghans but at the same time the Afghans used each empire to punish the other. In 1709, the [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotaki]] Afghans rose to power and completely defeated the Persian Empire. Then they marched towards the Mughals of India and nominally defeated them with the help of the Afsharid forces under Nader Shah Afshar.

In 1747, after Nader Shah of Persia was killed, a great leader named [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] united all the different Muslim tribes and established the Afghan Empire ([[Durrani Empire]]). He is considered the founding father of the modern state of Afghanistan<ref name="ReferenceA"/> while [[Mirwais Hotak]] is the grandfather of the nation.

===Recent history===
During the 1800s, Afghanistan became a buffer zone between two powerful empires, [[British India]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. As British India advanced into Afghanistan, Russia felt threatened and expanded southward across Central Asia. To stop the Russian advance, British tried to make Afghanistan part of its empire but the Afghans fought wars with British-led Indians from 1839 to 1842 and from 1878 to 1880. After the third war in 1919, Afghanistan under [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah]] gained respect and recognition as a completely independent state.

The Kingdom of Afghanistan was a [[constitutional monarchy]] established in 1926. It was the successor state to the [[Emirate of Afghanistan]]. On 27 September 1934, during the reign of Zahir Shah, the Kingdom of Afghanistan joined the [[League of Nations]].  During [[World War II]], Afghanistan remained neutral. It pursued a [[Diplomacy|diplomatic policy]] of non-alignment.

The creation of Pakistan in 1947 as its eastern neighbor created problems. In 1973, political crises led to the overthrow of the king. The country's new leader ended the monarchy and made Afghanistan a [[republic]]. In 1978, a [[Communist]] political party supported by the [[Soviet Union]] seized control of Afghanistan's government. This move sparked rebellions throughout the country. The government asked the Soviet Union for military assistance. The Soviets took advantage of the situation and [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|invaded Afghanistan in December 1979]].

Most people in Afghanistan opposed the sudden Soviet presence in their country. For nearly a decade, anti-Communist Islamic forces known as ''Mujahideen'' were trained inside neighboring Pakistan to fight the Soviets and the Afghan government. The [[United States]] and other anti-Soviet countries supported the Mujahideen. In the long war, over one million Afghan civilians were killed. The Soviet Army also lost more than 15,000 soldiers in that war. Millions of Afghans left their country to stay safe in neighboring Pakistan and Iran. In 1989 the Soviet Army withdrew the last of its troops.
[[File:2011 Afghan Independence Day-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Former [[President of Afghanistan|Afghan President]] [[Hamid Karzai]] at the 2011 Afghan Independence Day in [[Kabul]].]]
After the Soviets left, different Afghan warlords began fighting for control of the country. The warlords received support from other countries, including neighboring Pakistan and Iran. A very conservative [[Islamic]] group known as the [[Taliban]] emerged in an attempt to end the civil war. By the late 1990s the Taliban had gained control over 95% of Afghanistan. A group known as the Northern Alliance, based in northern Afghanistan near the border with Tajikistan, continued to fight against the Taliban.
[[File:Afghan soldiers.jpg|left|thumb|[[NATO]]-trained [[Afghan National Army]] (ANA).]]
[[File:Military terminal at Kabul International Airport.jpg|thumb|upright|NATO's military terminal at [[Kabul International Airport]]]]
The Taliban ruled Afghanistan according to their strict version of [[Islamic law]]. People whom the Taliban believed violated these laws were given cruel punishments. In addition, the Taliban completely restricted the rights of women. Because of such policies, most countries refused to recognize the Taliban government. Only [[Pakistan]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE) accepted them as the official government.

The Taliban also angered other countries by allowing suspected [[terrorist]]s to live freely in Afghanistan. Among them were [[Osama bin Laden]] and members of the [[al-Qaeda]] terrorist network. In September 2001, the United States blamed bin Laden for the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C.]] The Taliban refused to hand him over to the United States. In response, the United States and its allies launched a bombing campaign against al-Qaeda in October 2001. Within months the Taliban abandoned Kabul and a new government led by [[Hamid Karzai]] came to power, but fighting between the Taliban and US-led armies continued. The Taliban are coming into Afghanistan from neighboring Pakistan, Afghans accuse Pakistan's military of being behind the Taliban militants but Pakistan has rejected this and stated that a stable Afghanistan is in Pakistan's own interest.

In December 2004, Hamid Karzai became the first [[democracy|democratically]] elected president of Afghanistan.<ref name=cia/> [[NATO]] began rebuilding Afghanistan, including its military and government institutions. Many schools and colleges were built in the last ten years. Freedom for women improved, and they can now study, work, drive and run for offices. Many Afghan women work as politicians, some are ministers while at least one is a mayor. Others have opened businesses, or joined the military or police. Afghanistan's over-all economy has also improved dramatically and NATO states had agreed in 2012 to help the country for at least another 10 years after 2014. In the meantime, Afghanistan improved diplomatic ties with many countries in the world and continues to establish new ties with other states.

'''Argentina''' (officially the '''Argentine Republic''')  is a country in [[South America]]. Argentina is the second-largest [[country]] in [[South America]] and the eighth-largest country in the world.

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the language most people speak and the official language, but many other languages are spoken. 
There are minorities speaking [[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Quechua]] and even [[Welsh language|Welsh]] in [[Patagonia]].

The [[capital (city)|capital city]] of the Argentina is [[Buenos Aires]], one of the largest cities in the world, in eastern Argentina. In order by number of people, the largest [[city|cities]] in Argentina are [[Buenos Aires]], [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Rosario]], [[Mendoza]], [[La Plata]], [[Tucumán]], [[Mar del Plata]], [[Salta]], [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], and [[Bahía Blanca]].

Argentina is between the [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] in the west and the southern [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east and south. It is bordered by [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]] in the north, [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]] in the northeast, and [[Chile]] in the west and south. It also claims the [[Falkland Islands]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Islas Malvinas'') and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].

== History ==
The name '''Argentina''' comes from the [[Latin]] ''argentum'' ([[silver]]) as the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s believed the area had [[silver]]. In the Americas, Canada, US, Brazil and Argentina are the largest countries (in that order).

The oldest signs of people in Argentina are in the [[Patagonia]] (Piedra Museo, Santa Cruz), and are more than 13,000 years old. In 1480 the [[Inca Empire]] conquered northwestern Argentina, making it part of the empire. In the northeastern area, the [[Guaraní]] developed a culture based on [[yuca]] and [[sweet potato]] however typical dishes all around Argentina are pasta, red wines (Italian influence) and beef.

Other languages spoken are Italian, English and German. Lunfardo is Argentinean slang and is a mix of Spanish and Italian. Argentineans are said to speak Spanish with an Italian accent.

Argentina declared independent from Spain in 1816, and achieved it in 1818. It grew a lot after immigrants from Europe came to the country. By the 1920s it was the 7th wealthiest country in the world, but it began a decline after this. In the 1940s, following the "infamous decade" where the country's politics were not stable, [[Juan Peron]] came to power. Peron was one of the most important people in the country's history and many politicians today call themselves Peronist. Peron was forced out of power in 1955. After spending years in exile he returned to power in the 1970s.

In 1976, the country was falling into chaos, and the military took power. This was not the first time the military had done this. Leading the new government was [[Jorge Rafael Videla]]. Videla was one of history's most brutal dictators. Thousands of people disappeared or were killed during his time as president. Videla retired in 1980.

One of his successors was another general turned dictator, [[Leopoldo Galtieri]]. By the time Galtieri was in office in 1981 the dictatorship became unpopular. To try to stir up support, Galtieri ordered an invasion of the [[Falkland Islands]], starting a war. Argentina lost the war, and soon the country fell into chaos again. Galtieri was removed from power and eventually democracy was restored. Galtieri and Videla would be charged with "crimes against humanity" because of the mass murder and other crimes that they ordered as president.

Today, Argentina is one of the most important countries in Latin America, though it still has many problems facing it. It has a large economy and is an influential country in the "southern cone" of South America.

== Politics ==
Argentina is a [[federal republic]]. The people of Argentina vote for a [[President]] to rule them and [[Senator]]s and [[Deputy|Deputies]] to speak for them and make laws for them. The President is [[Mauricio Macri]] since December 2015.

== Administrative divisions ==
Argentina is divided into 23 [[province]]s (''provincias''; singular: ''provincia''), and 1 city (commonly known as ''capital federal''):

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Argentina}}
[[File:Argentina - Político.png|260px|thumb|left|alt=Map of Argentina|Map of Argentina]]

Argentina is almost 3,700&nbsp;km long from north to south, and 1,400&nbsp;km from east to west (maximum values). It can be divided into three parts: the [[Pampas]] in the central part of the country, [[Patagonia]] in the southern part down to [[Tierra del Fuego]]; and the [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] along the western border with [[Chile]], with the highest point in the province of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]. [[Cerro Aconcagua]], at 6,960 metres (22,834 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), is the [[Americas|Americas']] highest mountain.

The most important rivers include the [[Rio de la Plata|River Plate]], [[Paraguay River|Paraguay]], [[Bermejo River|Bermejo]], [[Colorado River (Argentina)|Colorado]], [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]] and the largest river, the [[Paraná River|Paraná]]. River Plate was incorrectly translated though, and should have been translated to English as River of (the) Silver. River Plate is also a famous Buenos Aires soccer team.

See [[List of cities in Argentina]] for the many places people live in Argentina.

== Other information ==
The majority of the Argentineans are descendants of Europeans mainly from [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[France]], other Europeans countries and [[Mestizo]] representing more than 90% of the total population of the country.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html World Factbook]</ref>

[[Football in Argentina|Football]] or soccer is the most popular sport, although the national sport of the country is [[Pato]]. Argentina has a number of highly ranked [[Polo]] players. Field hockey (for women) rugby and golf are also favorites.

Argentina is a [[Christian]] country. Most of Argentina's people (80 percent) are [[Roman Catholic]]. Argentina also has the largest population of Jewish community after Israel and US. Many Middle Eastern immigrants who were Muslims converted to Catholicism, but there are still Muslims as well.

Medicine is socialized and so is education, making Argentina's literacy rate about 98%. State University is free as well.

'''Austria''' ({{lang-de|Österreich}}; officially called '''Republic of Austria'''), is a country in [[Central Europe]]. Around Austria there are [[Germany]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Liechtenstein]]. Currently, the chancellor is [[:en:Christian_Kern|Christian Kern]]. The previous chancellor was [[Werner Faymann]] (2008 - 2016). Austria has been a [[state|member-state]] of the [[European Union|EU]] since [[1995]].

The people in Austria speak [[German language|German]], a few also [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The capital of Austria is [[Vienna]] (Wien).

Austria is more than a thousand years old. Its history can be followed to the [[ninth century]]. At that time the first people moved to the land now known as Austria. The name "Ostarrichi" is first written in an official document from [[996]]. Since then this word has developed into the Modern German word ''Österreich,'' which literally means "East Kingdom."

Austria is a democratic state and has nine federal states ({{lang-de|''Bundesländer''}}): [[Vorarlberg]], the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[Salzburg]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Vienna]] and [[Burgenland]]. It is a [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] state, that means it does not take part in wars with other countries. Austria has been in the [[United Nations]] since 1955 and in the [[European Union]] since 1995.

== History ==
=== Ancient times ===
There has been human settlement in the area that is now Austria for a long time. The first settlers go back to the Paleolithic age. That was the time of the [[Neanderthal]]s. They left works of art such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]]. In the Neolithic age people were living there to dig for [[mineral]] resources, especially [[copper]]. [[Ötzi the Iceman|Ötzi]], a [[mummy]] found in a [[glacier]] between Austria and Italy, is from that time. In the [[Bronze Age]] people built bigger settlements and fortresses, especially where there were [[mineral]] resources. [[Salt mine|Salt mining]] began near [[Hallstatt]]. At that time, [[Celt]]s began to form the first states.

=== The Romans ===
[[File:Austria Romana.png|left|thumb|Map]]
====The Roman cities and their modern names====
The Romans came 15 B.C. to Austria and made the Celtic Regnum Noricum to a province. Modern Austria was part of three provinces, Raetia, Noricum and Pannonia. The border in the north was the Danube.

=====Others=====
*Lentia- Linz
*Ovilava- Wels
*Veldidena- Wilten (now part of Innsbruck)
*Flavia Solva- near Leibniz

=== Modern times ===
Austria was the [[Austrian Empire]] from about 800 to [[1918]] and was ruled by The House of [[Habsburg]] for most of that period. Then it became a [[republic]]. The ''First Republic'' was from 1918 to 1938. From 1938 to 1945 Austria was part of Germany. The ''Second Republic'' was started in 1945.

== Geography ==
{{see also|List of settlements in Austria}}
[[File:Au-map.png|thumb|left|150px|Map of Austria]]
Austria is a largely [[mountain]]ous country since it is partially in the [[Alps]]. The high mountainous Alps in the west of Austria flatten somewhat into low lands and plains in the east of the country where the [[Danube]] flows.

== Culture ==
=== Music and Arts ===
Many famous composers were Austrians or born in Austria. There are [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Haydn|Joseph Haydn]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johann Strauss I|Johann Strauss, Sr.]], [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss, Jr.]] and [[Gustav Mahler]]. In modern times there were [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]] and [[Alban Berg]], who belonged to the [[Second Viennese School]].

Austria has many [[artist]]s, there are [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Egon Schiele]] or [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]], [[Inge Morath]] or [[Otto Wagner]] and scienc.

=== Food ===

'''Armenia''' (officially called the '''Republic of Armenia''') is a country in the western part of Asia. Its [[capital (city)|capital city]] is [[Yerevan]]. Armenia received its independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in [[1991]].

Armenia touches [[Turkey]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Iran]].

There are some minorities living in Armenia, such as [[Greece|Greek]], [[Russia]]n, and other minorities, and more than 90% of the people are ethnic [[Armenians]].  Also, the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], is by far the largest religion in the country. There is a small amount of other [[Christians]], [[Muslims]] and [[atheists]].

Armenia is the place that some Christians believe [[Noah's Ark]] landed, and Noah's family settled.  The Armenian name for Armenia (Hayastan) means Land of Haik.  Haik was the name of a great-great-grandson of [[Noah]].

Throughout history, Armenia's size has changed many times.  Today Armenia is much smaller than it was once. In 80 BCE, the Kingdom of Armenia covered parts of what is today Turkey, [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], Azerbaijan, and, of course, Armenia.

From [[1920]] to [[1991]], Armenia was a member of the [[Soviet Union]].

Today, Armenia's borders are locked with [[Turkey]] and [[Azerbaijan]], due to conflicts. In 1992, Armenia and Azerbaijan had a war over the land of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. The fighting stopped in 1994, and Armenia has had control over this land, but Azerbaijan still disputes about the land.

Armenia is [[landlocked country|landlocked]] in the [[Transcaucasus|South Caucasus]]. It is between the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Caspian Sea]]s. The country is bordered on the north and east by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], and on the south and west by [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]].

It covers an area of {{convert|29743|km2|sqmi|0}}. The land is mostly mountains, with fast flowing rivers and few forests. There are hot summers and cold winters. 

[[Mount Ararat]] used to be part of Armenia. It is the highest mountain in the region. It is now in Turkey, but clearly visible in Armenia. The Armenians see it as a [[symbol]] of their land. Because of this, the mountain is present on the [[Coat of arms of Armenia|Armenian national emblem]] today.

== Provinces ==
Armenia is divided into ten [[provinces]] and the capital city of [[Yerevan]].  As of 2007, Armenia includes 915 communities.  49 are considered [[urban]] and 866 are considered [[rural]].  For a list of communities see [[List of settlements in Armenia]].

'''Archaeology''' is the study of the [[past]] by looking for the remains and artifacts ([[history|historical things]]) left by the people who lived long ago. These remains can include old [[coin]]s, [[tool]]s, [[building]]s, and inscriptions.  Archaeologists, the people who study archaeology, use these remains to understand how people lived.

Archaeologists think it is important to understand the past, because so many people use the past to know where they come from.

== Fieldwork ==
When archaeologists do fieldwork, they look for remains, often by digging deep in the ground. When things are found, or even when nothing is found, the results of the fieldwork are taken back to the place where the archaeologist's base is, maybe a [[university]] or [[museum]]. They record everything they found by writing down on paper or entering the information into a computer, so that they can build a picture of everything that is found. As [[Human settlement|settlements]] (places where people lived in groups) change and grow, old buildings are often buried to make space for new buildings. Ancient [[Rome]], for example, is now up to 40 feet (12 metres) below the present city. This is why archaeological fieldwork is expensive and why it takes a long time.

==Fields of interest==
[[Archaeologist]]s do not all study the same [[civilization]]s, they specialize in different areas of interest. Some fields of interest include [[Ancient Egypt]] (these specialists are called [[Egyptologist]]s), [[Ancient China]], or the [[Vikings]]. Archaeologists study every [[civilization]] that is known, especially the ones where there is no written [[history]]. They can study any time period. For example, one might study the [[human evolution|beginning of human life]] in Africa, or study [[World War II]]. Marine archaeologists study things that are now underwater. They search for [[shipwreck|sunken ships]] or [[city|cities]] that have been lost under the sea.

==Sites==
[[Stonehenge]], in [[England]], is a famous archaeological site, or place. Other famous sites include the [[Roman Forum]], [[Angkor Wat]], [[Machu Picchu]], and [[Great Zimbabwe]]. In many countries, [[government]]s and other groups of people protect important sites so that they will not be destroyed and so that visitors can always come and see them.

Sometimes archaeological sites are found when foundations are dug for new [[building]]s. Archaeologists have to work quickly when this happens, because people who are building often don't have a lot of time. Many times as soon as the archaeologists are done with their work, the remains that they have found will be covered over, unless they are very important.

'''Animals''' are [[eukaryotic]] organisms with [[Multicellular organism|many cells]]. They do not use [[light]] to get [[energy]] as [[plants]] do. The study of animals is called [[zoology]].<ref>Ville C.A; Walker W.F. & Barnes R.D. 1984. ''General zoology''. Saunders</ref><ref>Hamilton, Gina. ''Kingdoms of life – Animals''. Lorenz Educational Press. ISBN 978-1-4291-1610-7</ref> Animals use different ways to get energy from other living things. They usually eat other living things, but some are [[parasitism|parasites]] or have [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[protist]]s as [[symbiosis|symbionts]].

Plants are also [[multicellular]] eukaryotic [[organism]]s, but most animals are [[motile|mobile]], meaning they can move around. Animals take in [[oxygen]], and give out [[carbon dioxide]]. This [[cellular respiration]] is part of their [[metabolism]] (chemical working). In both these ways they are different from [[plants]]. Also, the cells of animals have different [[cell membrane]]s to other [[eukaryotes]] like plants and [[fungi]].

== Grouping animals ==
There are many types of animals. The common animals most [[people]] know are only about 3% of the animal kingdom. When [[biologists]] look at animals, they find things that certain animals have in common. They use this to group the animals in a [[biological classification]]. They think several million species exist but they have only identified about one million.

Animals can mainly be divided into two main groups: the [[invertebrate]]s and the [[vertebrate]]s. Vertebrates have a [[backbone]], or [[spine]]; invertebrates do not.

Vertebrates are:
*[[fish]] (or 'fishes': both ways are correct)
*[[amphibian]]s
*[[reptile]]s
*[[bird]]s
*[[mammal]]s

Some invertebrates are:
*[[insect]]s
*[[spider]]s
*[[crustacean]]s
*[[mollusc]]s (like [[squid]])
*[[worm]]s
*[[jellyfish]]

== Life styles ==
The animal mode of [[nutrition]] is called [[heterotroph]]ic because they get their food from other living organisms. Some animals eat only plants; they are called [[herbivore]]s. Other animals eat only [[meat]] and are called [[carnivore]]s. Animals that eat both plants and meat are called [[omnivore]]s.

The [[environments]] animals live in vary greatly. By the process of [[evolution]], animals [[Adaptation|adapt]] to the [[habitats]] they live in. A [[fish]] is adapted to its life in water and a [[spider]] is adapted to a life catching and eating insects. A [[mammal]] living on the [[savannah]]s of [[East Africa]] lives quite a different life from a mammal like a [[porpoise]] catching fish in the sea.

The [[fossil]] record of animals goes back about 600 million years to the [[Ediacaran]] period, or somewhat earlier.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Possible animal-body fossils in pre-Marinoan limestones from South Australia |journal= Nature Geoscience | volume= 3 | pages= 653–659  |url= http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v3/n9/full/ngeo934.html |doi=10.1038/ngeo934 | issue= 9|bibcode = 2010NatGe...3..653M|last1= Maloof, Adam C. ''et al'' 2010}} [http://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/people/maloof/papers_pub/24Maloof.pdf Pdf]. These fossils are interpreted as being early sponges. They were found in 665-million-year-old rock.</ref> During the whole of this long period of time animals have been constantly changing, so that the animals alive on [[Earth]] today are very different from those on the edges of the sea-floor in the Ediacaran. The study of ancient life is called [[palaeontology]].

[[Category:Basic English 850 words]]'''Acceleration''' is a [[measure]] of how [[speed|fast]] [[velocity]] [[wikt:change|changes]]. Acceleration is the change of velocity [[Division (mathematics)|divide]]d by the change of [[time]]. Acceleration is a [[vector]], and therefore includes both a [[size]] and a [[direction]].
 
== Examples ==
* An object was moving [[north]] at 10 meters per second. The object speeds up and now is moving north at 15 [[meter]]s per [[second]]. The object has accelerated. 
* An [[apple]] is falling down. It starts falling at 0 meters per second. At the end of the first second, the apple is moving at 9.8 meters per second. The apple has accelerated. At the end of the second second, the apple is moving down at 19.6 meters per second. The apple has accelerated again.
* Jane is walking [[east]] at 3 [[kilometer]]s per [[hour]]. Jane's velocity does not change. Jane's acceleration is [[zero]]. 
* Tom was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Tom turns and walks [[south]] at 3 kilometers per hour. Tom has had a nonzero acceleration. 
* Sally was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Sally slows down. After, Sally walks east at 1.5 kilometers per hour. Sally has had a nonzero acceleration.
* [[Acceleration due to gravity]]

== Finding acceleration ==

Acceleration is the [[rate (mathematics)|rate]] of change of the [[velocity]] of an object. Acceleration <math>\\mathbf{{a}}</math> can be found by using:<br />
:<math>
\\mathbf{{a}} = {\\mathbf{v_1} - \\mathbf{v_0} \\over { t_1 - t_0 }}</math>

where
:<math>\\mathbf{v_0}</math> is the velocity at the start
:<math>\\mathbf{v_1}</math> is the velocity at the end
:<math>t_0</math> is the time at the start 
:<math>t_1</math> is the time at the end 

Sometimes the change in velocity <math> \\mathbf{v_1} - \\mathbf{v_0}</math> is written as Δ<math>\\mathbf{v}</math>. Sometimes the change in time <math>{ t_1 - t_0 }</math> is written as Δt.

In difficult situations, the acceleration can be calculated using [[mathematics]]: in [[calculus]], acceleration is the [[Derivative (mathematics)|derivative]] of the velocity (with respect to time), <math>\\mathbf{a} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{v}}{\\mathrm{d}t}</math>.

=== Units of measurement ===
Acceleration has its own [[units of measurement]]. For example, if velocity is measured in meters per second, and if time is measured in seconds, then acceleration is measured in meters per second squared  (m/s<sup>2</sup>).

=== Other words ===
Acceleration can be [[positive]] or [[negative number|negative]]. When the acceleration is negative (but the velocity does not change direction), it is sometimes called deceleration. For example, when a car brakes it decelerates. Physicists usually only use the word "acceleration".

== Newton's second law of motion ==
Newton's laws of motion are [[rule]]s for how things [[Movement|move]]. These rules are called "[[law]]s of [[motion (physics)|motion]]". [[Isaac Newton]] is the [[scientist]] who first wrote down the main laws of motion.
According to [[Newton's laws of motion#Second Law|Newton's Second Law of Motion]], the [[Force (physics)|force]] something needs to accelerate an object depends on the object's [[mass]] (the amount of "stuff" the object is made from or how "heavy" it is).
The formula of Newton's Second Law of Motion is <math>\\mathbf{F} = m \\mathbf{a}</math>,
where <math>\\mathbf{a}</math> is the acceleration, <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> is the force, and <math>m</math> the mass. 
This formula is very well-known, and it is very important in [[physics]]. Newton's Second Law of Motion, in short "Newton's Second Law", is often one of the first things that physics students learn.

== Deceleration ==
Deceleration is the opposite of acceleration. This means that something slows down instead of speeding up. For example, when a car brakes, it is decelerating.

[[Category:Mechanics]]'''Black pudding''' is an English name for blood sausage.  It is [[food]] made by [[cooking]] down the [[blood]] of any [[mammal]] (usually [[pig]]s or cattle) with meat, fat or filler until it is thick enough to [[congealing|congeal]] (become firm or solid) when cooled.

==Types of Black pudding==
[[File:Blutwurst.jpg|thumb|German ''Blutwurst'']]
In [[Great Britain]], blood sausage is called  ''Black Pudding''. The ingredients include pig's blood, [[suet]], [[bread]], [[barley]] and [[oats|oatmeal]]. The most common kind of German ''blutwurst'' is made from fatty pork meat, beef blood and filler such as barley. Though already cooked and "ready to eat" it is usually served warm.

Other kinds of blood sausage include ''boudin noir'' (France), ''boudin rouge'' ([[Creole]] and [[Cajun]]) and ''morcilla'' (Spain).

==History==
A [[legend]] says that blood sausage was invented in a [[gambling|bet]] between two [[Bavarian]] [[butcher]]s drunk on the alcoholic drink [[absinthe]] during the [[14th century]]. [[Homer]]'s ''Odyssey'' from Ancient [[Greece]] says that "As when a man besides a great fire has filled a sausage with fat and blood and turns it this way and that and is very eager to get it quickly roasted...".

[[Category:Sausage]]A '''boot device''' is used to start a [[computer]].  It is named after a [[boot]] which fits on the [[foot]].  The word [[bootstrap]] is also closely related, and means, to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better. It comes from the English phrase "pull yourself up by your own bootstraps."

Before a computer can operate normally, it must have [[operating system]] instructions that tell it how to perform basic functions.  A boot device loads the operating system into the [[memory]] of the computer. 

Devices that can boot a computer are usually '''boot disks''' or '''boot drives''' 
(normally a [[hard drive]], but can be a [[floppy disk]] or a [[compact disk|CD]]).  Some [[network computer]]s use ''boot chips'' that get the [[operating system]] over a [[network]].  [[Web phone]]s also use such chips to identify the user to the [[cell network]].  '''Boot card''' standards may let many users boot [[kiosk computer]]s with full [[privacy]] and access to all [[applications]] they own. There are also '''boot boards''' or '''boot ''add-in'' cards''' that are more permanent than boot cards.

Some people refer to the boot device as just a '''boot''' and non-boot devices as '''data device'''s, although it is not the [[computer]] but the [[operating system]] that cares about the difference between these.

==Origin==
The boot in '''boot device''' is the same as [[booting]] (or starting up). This is short for bootstrapping, or to start with simple stuff and make complex stuff out of it.

[[File:Boots-WhiteLeather-6cmHeel.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]
A '''boot''' is a type of [[footwear]] that protects the [[foot]] and [[ankle]]. Boots are higher and larger than [[shoe]]s and [[sandal]]s. Some boots are high enough to protect the [[leg|calves]] (lower part of the leg) as well.  Some boots are held on with ''bootstraps'' or ''bootlaces''.  Some also have '''spats''' or ''gaiters'' to keep water out.  Most have a very strong ''boot sole'', the bottom part of a boot.

== Types of boots ==
* '''Rain boots''' (or rubber boots) are made from [[rubber]] or [[plastic]]. Rain boots protect a person's feet from [[water]] and [[rain]]. People who work on [[fishing]] boats and [[farmer]]s wear rubber boots to keep their feet dry. People who work in [[chemical industry|chemical]] factories wear rubber boots to protect their feet from dangerous chemicals.

* '''Winter boots''' are boots that keep a person's feet warm in cold weather. People in cold countries such as [[Canada]] and [[Sweden]] wear winter boots during the cold season. Winter boots can be made from many different materials, such as [[leather]], [[fabric]], or [[plastic]]. Winter boots are [[thermal insulation|insulated]] with wool or fur to keep the feet warm. Most winter boots also keep people's feet dry.

* '''Work boots''' (or "[[construction]] boots") are designed for people who work in construction or [[factory]] jobs. Work boots often have a steel toe cover to protect the person's toes. Work boots are usually made of strong leather, to protect the person's foot from sharp objects or dangerous chemicals. Some work boots have a flat piece of [[steel]] in the sole to protect the foot from sharp [[nail]]s. Many countries require construction workers to wear work boots when they are on a construction site.

[[Category:Basic English 850 words]]
[[Category:Footwear]]'''Bankruptcy''' is a [[law|legal process]] which happens when a person or an organisation does not have enough [[money]] to pay all of its [[debt]]s.  Legally they are insolvent.

Where it is a person who cannot pay their debts, the person's creditors may ask the court to appoint a ''trustee in bankruptcy''.   This is a professional accountant who is appointed by the court, and they will take control of the bankrupt person's assets.  Some assets are protected by law, but the trustee in bankruptcy will sell off all of the other assets and use the proceeds to pay as much of that person's debts as possible.  After the process is complete the person is ''discharged from bankruptcy'', and the person is free from any further liability to pay those claims, but normally that person will be limited in their ability to borrow money again because their credit rating will be damaged.

Where it is an organisation who cannot pay their debts, the creditors may ask the court to appoint a ''liquidator''.  The liquidator does a very similar job to the trustee in bankruptcy except that there are no assets which are protected so the liquidator can sell everything.  Once all of the assets of the organisation have been sold, the organisation is then ''dissolved'' and no longer exists.  Organisations do not get discharged from bankruptcy in the same way that a living person does.

== Insolvency or bankrupcy ==
People often confuse the terms '''bankruptcy''' and '''[[insolvency]]''', and sometimes they use one word when they really mean the other.  Insolvency usually just means that a someone does not have enough money to pay their debts or (sometimes) that the total amount of their debts is worth more than the total amount of their assets.  Bankruptcy is a formal legal process in front of the courts.  Although the two terms are connected, just because a person is insolvent does not necessarily mean that they will go into bankruptcy.

== Alternatives to bankruptcy ==
Many countries have alternatives to bankruptcy to try and allow people and businesses to try and avoid the bankruptcy process.

In various countries, individual people can try and reach ''individual voluntary arrangements'' (or IVAs) with their creditors.  This means that the creditors agree to take less money to discharge their debts.  There are similar processes for companies and other organisations, and they go by various different names in different countries, but in many countries they are called ''schemes of arrangement''.

== Bankruptcy protection ==
In many countries a [[company]] or [[business]] can ask the courts for ''bankruptcy protection'' to try and protect the business so that the [[creditor]]s cannot destroy all of the [[physical capital]] and [[goodwill]] by breaking it apart and moving it away. The aim of this is provide is more [[time]] for the business to reorganise itself and to work out a new deal between the owners and the people the business owes money.  In many countries this is called ''going into administration'', although in the United States it is usually referred as ''going into Chapter 11''.

However, not all countries have bankruptcy protection laws for businesses.

== Debt slavery ==
Often a [[creditor]] threatens a [[debtor]] with [[debt slavery]] in many parts of the world.<ref name=NoackWP>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/11/18/map-the-worlds-36-million-slaves/ |title=Map: The world’s 36 million slaves |author=Rick Noack |date=18 November 2014 |website= |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref> In some cases the debtor does not know that they have a right to go '''bankrupt'''. This is a [[human rights]] problem in some countries.<ref name=NoackWP/> Also, some creditors continue to harass a debtor even though bankruptcy laws say they should not, hoping that the debtor will pay them money that they do not deserve.

== United States ==
Chapter 7 of the Title 11 of the [[United States]] [[Law|Code]] (Bankruptcy Code) can be filed by [[business]]es or individuals.<ref name=NOLO>{{cite web |url=http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/chapter-7-13-bankruptcy-basics-29829.html |title=What Is Bankruptcy? |author= |date= |website= |publisher=NOLO |accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref> It is also called [[liquidation]] bankruptcy because some of a debtor's [[property]] may be sold (liquidated) to satisfy creditors.<ref name=NOLO/> Chapter 13 is the most popular form of bankruptcy in the United States.<ref name=NOLO/> When a [[business]] is in [[debt]] and cannot pay it, it may ask or be forced to file bankruptcy in court under Chapter 7.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/109|title=11 U.S. Code § 109 - Who may be a debtor|work=cornell.edu|accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref> A chapter 7 usually makes a [[company]] stop doing business. [[Employee]]s often lose their jobs when company files for chapter 7. When chapter 7 is filed, the [[trustee]] is chosen. The trustee is in charge of managing the [[business]] and selling its [[asset]]s to pay the [[creditor]]s.

[[Category:Economics]]'''Breakfast sausage''' is a type of fresh [[pork]] [[sausage]] made from [[season]]ed [[ground]] [[meat]] mixed with [[bread]] crumbs. Breakfast sausage has a blander flavor than many other types of sausage, such as Polish or Italian-style sausages.

==Using breakfast sausages==
Breakfast sausages are not [[curing|cured]] or [[smoking|smoked]] like other types of sausages, which means that they have to be cooked soon after they are purchased (unless they are frozen).  Uncooked sausages should be stored in the [[refrigerator]] or the [[Refrigerator|freezer]]. Individuals handling them should wash their hands in hot [[soap]]y water, because uncooked pork is unhealthy for humans. Pork sausages have to be heated until all of the meat inside is cooked. 

They are usually [[Frying|fried]] or grilled in a pan until they are browned and served at [[breakfast]], often with cooked [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[pancake]]s, and [[toast]]ed bread. Breakfast sausages are also used in other dishes, such as "toad in the hole" a cooked batter dish.

==Types of breakfast sausages==
Different types made from pork and [[beef]] mixtures as well as [[poultry]] can now be found. There are also [[vegetarian]] types that use [[tofu|textured vegetable protein]] in place of meat. Breakfast sausages are available in patties or slices from a large roll, or in weiner-like links of different lengths and thickness.

'''Beekeeping''' or '''apiculture''' is the [[farming]] of [[honeybee]]s.

== Uses ==
The keeping of bees is usually, and has been in the past, for [[honey]]. That is becoming less true. Instead, it is more used for [[crop]] [[pollination]] and other products. These are [[:wikt:wax|wax]] and [[propolis]].

There is only one queen bee in each hive and she is bigger than the rest. She lays all the eggs, which makes all the other bees in the hive her daughters and sons. However, they do not control the hive.

== Types of beekeeping ==
The largest beekeeping operations are agricultural businesses that are operated for profit. Some people also have small beekeeping operations that they do as a [[hobby]]. Urban beekeeping is a growing trend, and some have found that "city bees" are actually healthier than "rural bees" because there are fewer pesticides and greater biodiversity.<ref>http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jun/23/can-cities-save-bees</ref>

==Threats==
[[Colony Collapse Disorder]] is a growing problem, along with [[mite]]s.

<!-- interwiki -->'''British English''' is the kind of [[English language]] which is used in the [[United Kingdom]], and in most countries which were in the [[British Empire]].

== Pronunciation in British English ==
In the United Kingdom, many different people say words in different ways. For example: a man from a place near [[London]] may not say his "r"s the same as a man from [[Scotland]] or a man from [[Northern Ireland]]. Across the country the accent is different. For instance in [[Liverpool]] one speaks with a "scouse" accent or in [[London]] one speaks with a "cockney" accent. Different variations on all of British English exist from the manner in which words are pronounced to the manner in which they are spelt. One place people speak English in a different way is [[Cornwall]], where the [[Cornish dialect]] is spoken. 

=== Other languages ===
Britain, like other countries, has languages other than English. In [[Wales]] many speak [[Welsh language|Welsh]]; in [[Scotland]] some people speak [[Gaelic]], and in [[Ireland]] a few people speak [[Irish language|Irish]]. However, that is not the subject of this particular article.

== Spelling in British English ==
British English often keeps more traditional ways of spelling words than American English. 

* Some British English words end in "re", because the words were originally taken from [[French language|French]].  They are often simplified to "er" in American English
::British English: centre, litre, metre.
::American English: center, liter, meter.
* Some British English words end in "our" and are simplified to "or" in American English. The English spelling also came from the French language.
::British English: colour, favour, honour, labour
::American English: color, favor, honor, labor
* Some British English words the have come originally from the Greek language use "ph". This has been changed to "f" in some other languages.
::British English: Sulphur
:: American English: Sulfur
* Some words in British English use "s" where "z" is used in American English. However, spelling them with "z" is also done in Britain sometimes.
::British English: colonisation, realisation, organisation
::American English: colonization, realization, organization
* The word "[[gray]]" is also a special case, as it is normally spelled "gray" in American English and "grey" in British English. However, "gray" is also used in Britain, and "grey" is also used in America.
* Many of these rules are also used in other countries outside of the [[United Kingdom]], mostly in countries that are members in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

== Vocabulary in British English ==
In British English, "dock" refers to the [[water]] in the space between two "piers" or "wharfs". In American English, the "pier" or "wharf" could be called a "dock", and the water between would be a "slip".

Some common differences:

British – American
* accelerator – throttle{{fact|date=October 2015}}
* [[autumn]] – fall
* [[biscuit]] – cookie
* bonnet – hood (of a car)
* [[boot]] – trunk (of a car)
* bum – butt
* caravan – trailer, mobile home
* chips – [[French fries]]
* courgette – [[zucchini]]
* crisps – chips
* face flannel – washcloth
* flat – apartment
* [[football (soccer)|football]] – soccer
* garden – yard
* handbag – purse
* jumper – sweater
* [[lift]] – elevator
* lorry – truck
* manual gearbox – stick shift
* metro, underground, tube – subway
* motorway – freeway
* mum – mom
* nappy – diaper
* number plate – license plate
* pants - underpants
* pavement – sidewalk
* pram – stroller
* petrol – gas or gasoline
* phone box - phone booth
* post – mail, mailbox
* [[railway]] – railroad
* shifting – moving
* shopping trolley – shopping cart
* surname – last name
* take-away – take-out
* trousers – pants
* to let – to rent
* torch – flashlight
* tram – streetcar

== Usage in different countries ==
[[American English]] is only an official language in the [[United States]]. In [[Canada]], American English spelling is sometimes used, but traditionally, British English is used. Although Commonwealth English is the most spoken, American English is seen more often on the internet. American English vocabulary dominates the visual media: "movies" (British: "films") and television.

All [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations and Africa learn Commonwealth English, while American English is often learnt in the Americas and China. Z pronounced 'Zee' is only seen in the U.S.A and less commonly in Canada, while Z pronounced 'Zed' is spoken almost everywhere else. The United Kingdom and Ireland use British layout keyboards, while Australia, South Africa, Canada, New Zealand and the U.S.A use American layout keyboards. In continental [[Europe]] [[English as a second language]] is nowadays sometimes even taught in American English, except perhaps in [[Scandinavia]] and the [[Netherlands]].

[[File:Beijing in China (+all claims hatched).svg|thumb|Beijing in China]]
[[File:Beijing Financial Street (overlook).jpg|thumb|Beijing]]

'''Beijing''' ({{lang-zh|北京}}, Běijīng) is the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]. The city used to be known as '''''[[Peking]]'''''.  It is in the northern and eastern parts of the country.

The city of Beijing has played a very important role in the development of China. Many people from different cities and countries come to Beijing to look for better chances to find work. Nearly 15 million people live there. In 2008 Beijing hosted the [[Summer Olympic Games]], and will host the 2022 [[Winter Olympic Games]]. It will be the only city to host both.

Beijing is well known for its ancient history.  Since the [[Jin Dynasty]], Beijing has been the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of several [[dynasties]] (especially the later ones), including the Yuan, Ming, and Qing. There are many places of historic interest in Beijing.  These places include the [[Summer Palace]] (Yìhéyuán), the Temple of Heaven (Tiāntán), [[Tiananmen Square]] (Tiānānmén Guǎngchǎng), the [[Forbidden City]] (Zǐjìnchéng), and the [[Great Wall of China]] (Chángchéng).

== What This Means==
Beijing simply means "the northern capital" in the [[Chinese language]].  It was once a counterpart of [[Nanjing]], "the southern capital", during the Ming Dynasty.  This dynasty gave Beijing its name.  When the city did not serve as the capital city, the city reverts to its original name of Beiping, "northern peace"; this occurred between 1928 and 1949 when Nanjing was the capital of the Republic of China.

== History ==
The center of Beijing was settled in the [[1st millennium BC]]. In those days, the Kingdom of Yan (燕, Yān) set up their capital where Beijing is today.<ref name="CD History">{{citeweb|url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Beijing-History.html |title=History - Beijing |accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref> They called it Ji (蓟, Jì). After the Kingdom of Yan was destroyed, the city became smaller, although it was still an important place.

Beijing became more important again in the 10th century, when the Jin dynasty set its capital there. This city was destroyed by [[Mongol]] forces in [[1215]].  Then in [[1267]], Mongols built a new city on the north side of the Jin capital, and called it "Great Capital" (大都, Dàdū), which was the beginning of modern Beijing. When [[Kublai Khan]] the Mongolian monarch, set up the Yuan dynasty, this city became his capital.

The [[Yuan Dynasty]], [[Ming Dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]] all made Beijing their capital. When the Qing dynasty lost power and the Republic of China was set up, the new Republic moved its capital from Beijing to Nanjing. When the People's Republic of China seized power, Beijing became the capital of China again.

In 1989, there were [[protest]]s in [[Tiananmen Square|Tian'anmen Square]] because some people wanted [[democracy]].<ref name="CD History" />

== Education ==
Beijing is the education center of People's Republic of China. More than 500 famous universities of China are in Beijing.  They also include 5 of the top universities: [[Peking University]], Tsinghua University, China People University, Beijing Normal University, and Beihang University. Beijing is also education center of China for teaching Chinese as a foreign language. The standard Chinese pronunciation is based on Beijing dialect, so over 70% foreigners who want to study Chinese go to Beijing for their studies.

[[File:Berries (USDA ARS).jpg|250px|thumb|right|Several types of common "berries". None is a berry by botanical definition:<br />The blueberry is a [[false berry]], blackberries are [[aggregate fruit]], and strawberries are [[accessory fruit]].]]
The word '''berry''' is used for many different kinds of small [[fruit]]s that have many [[seeds]] and can be used as food. Some examples are [[strawberry]], [[raspberry]], [[blueberry]] and [[lingonberry]].

When [[botany|botanists]] talk about ''berries'', they mean a simple [[fruit]] produced from a single [[gynoecium|ovary]]. They sometimes call this ''true berry'', to distinguish it from ''false berries''. By that statement of how words are used, [[grape]]s or [[tomato]]es are true berries.

The berry is the most common type of soft fruit in which the entire ovary wall gets to the right stage of development of the [[pericarp]] which can be taken as food. The flowers of these plants have an upper ovary with one or more [[carpel]]s. The seeds are inside the soft body of the ovary.

Berries are small, sweet, bright colored fruits. Due to this, they are able to bring more [[animal]]s towards them and spread their [[seed]]s.

Some fruits that are called ''berries'' in [[English language|English]] are not ''true berries'' by the use of words above. These include strawberries, [[blackberry|blackberries]], [[raspberry|raspberries]], [[cranberry|cranberries]], and [[boysenberry|boysenberries]]. Some true berries do not have ''berry'' in their name. These include [[tomato]]es, [[eggplant]]s, [[guava]]s, [[pomegranate]]s and [[chile pepper|chillies]]. [[Pumpkin]]s, [[cucumber]]s, [[melon]]s, [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] and [[lemon]]s are also berries that have slightly different structure and may be called by different names ([[pepo]] for pumpkins, cucumbers, and melons, or [[hesperidium]] for oranges and lemons).

A '''beard''' is the [[hair]] growing on the lower part of a [[man]]'s [[face]].

The hair that grows on the upper [[lip]] of some men is a [[mustache]].  When a man has hair only below the lower lip and above the chin, it is called a [[soul patch]].  Some men have a lot of hair and a big beard, and some have very little. In the modern world, many men [[shave]] part or all of their beards, or cut their beard so it does not get very long. Women can also have beards, but it is less common. 

Some [[animal]]s also have hair like this, and people sometimes also call this hair a '''beard'''.

In light, '''black''' is lack of all [[color]].  In [[painting]], however, the black [[pigment]] is the combination of all colors.  In [[heraldry]], black is called "sable".

==Origin of ''black''==
The word black comes from Old English blæc ("black, dark", also, "ink"), from Proto-Germanic *blakkaz ("burned"), and from Proto-Indo-European *bhleg-. In many languages, ''black'' has the same meaning as ''ink''.

==Black in science==
In science, an object that is black absorbs the light that hits it. Because these objects do not reflect any light, the human [[eye]] can't see any color coming from that object. The [[brain]] then sees these objects as black.


A way to create black objects is to mix [[pigment|pigments]]. A pigment works by reflecting only the color of the pigment. For example, a blue pigment absorbs all colors except blue. By mixing pigments in the right quantities, black can be made.


Because black objects absorb light, they become warmer faster.

== Meaning of black ==

Black is associated with power, elegance, formality, [[anarchy]], birth, male, and mystery. Black is a dark color, the darkest color there is. Black, along with gray and white, is a ''neutral'' color. This means that it is not a ''hot'' color or a ''cool'' color.

Black is a color seen with fear and the unknown (black holes). It have a good meaning (blacklist, 'black birth', black bat) or a good meaning ('in the black', 'black is beautiful'). Black can stand for strength and power. It can be a [[formal]], elegant, and high-class color (black tie, black Mercedes, black man). Black clothing is common in [[emo]] and [[goth subculture]].

'''Bubonic plague''' is the best-known form of the disease [[plague]], which is caused by the [[bacterium]] ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. The name ''bubonic plague'' is specific for this form of the disease, which enters through the skin, and travels through the [[lymphatic system]]. 

If the disease is left untreated, it kills about half its victims, in between three and seven days. The bubonic plague was the disease that caused the [[Black Death]], which killed tens of millions of people in Europe, in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/03/0310_040310_blackdeath.html|title=Bubonic Plague Traced to Ancient Egypt|first=Cameron|last=Walker|publisher=National Geographic News|date=10 March, 2004|accessdate=2 April, 2009}}</ref>

[[Symptom]]s of this disease include [[cough]]ing, [[fever]], and black spots on the [[skin]].

== Different kinds of the same disease ==
There are different kinds of Bubonic plague. The most common form of the disease is spread by a certain kind of [[flea]], that lives on [[rat]]s. Then there is an [[incubation period]] which can last from a few hours to about seven days. 
=== [[Septicemic plague]] ===
[[Sepsis]] happens when the bacterium enters the [[blood]] and make it form tiny clots.
=== [[Pneumonic]] plague ===
This happens when the bacterium can enter the lungs. About 95% of all people with this form will die. Incubation period is only one to two days.

=== The abortive form ===
This is the most harmless form. It will result in a little [[fever]]. After that, there are [[antibody|antibodies]] that protect against all forms for a long time.

== History ==
During the 1300s, this [[epidemic]] struck parts of [[Asia]], [[North Africa]], and [[Europe]]. Almost a third of the people in Europe died of it. Unlike [[wikt:catastrophe|catastrophe]]s that pull communities together, this epidemic was so terrifying that it broke people's trust in one another. [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], an [[Italy|Italian]] writer of the time, described it: ''"This [[wikt:scourge|scourge]] had implanted so great a terror in the hearts of men and women that brothers [[wikt:abandon|abandon]]ed brothers, uncles their nephews, sisters their brothers, and in many cases wives deserted their husbands. But even worse,... fathers and mothers refused to nurse and assist their own children."''<ref>The decameron / Giovanni Boccaccio ; translated by Mark Musa & Peter Bondanella ; with an introduction by Thomas G. Bergin. ISBN 0-451-52866-2</ref>

== Transmission ==
[[File:Flea infected with yersinia pestis.jpg|thumb|[[Oriental rat flea]] (''Xenopsylla cheopis'') infected with the ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' [[Bacteria|bacterium]] which appears as a dark mass in the gut. The foregut of this flea is blocked by a ''Y. pestis'' [[biofilm]]; when the flea attempts to feed on an uninfected [[Host (biology)|host]] ''Y. pestis'' from the foregut is [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitated]] into the wound, causing [[infection]].]]
The plague was not just carried by [[rat]]s as some people assume. The [[flea]]s also carried it. It came abroad from [[Kaffa]] by the [[Black Sea]]. From there the disease started to go new places in [[1347]]. It went to [[England]] in [[1349]]. There it killed '''half''' of the people in England. 70% of people who got plague died. Pigs are also to blame for the transmission, as the bacteria stayed in their blood system, and when eaten, people caught the plague. This is a reason why so few Jews or Muslims caught the disease.

== Modern history ==
In the [[20th century]], some countries did [[research]] on the [[bacteria]] that causes bubonic plague. They did research to use it for [[biological warfare]].

Samples of this [[bacteria]] are carefully controlled. There is much [[paranoia]] (fear) about it. Dr. Thomas C. Butler, a [[United States|US]] expert in this [[organism]] was charged in October [[2003]] by the [[FBI]] with various [[crime]]s. This happened after he said he lost samples of ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. This is the bacteria that causes bubonic plague. The FBI did not find the samples. They do not know what happened to them.

'''Biology''' is the [[science]] of life and living things, and their  [[evolution]]. Living things include [[plants]], [[animals]], [[fungi]] (such as [[mushroom]]s), and [[microorganisms]] such as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].

People who study biology are called [[biologists]]. Biology looks at how animals and other organisms behave and work, and what they are like. Biology also studies how [[organism]]s react with each other and the [[environment]]. It has existed as a [[science]] for about 200 years, and was preceded by [[natural history]]. Biology has many [[research]] fields and [[branch]]es. Like all sciences, biology uses the [[scientific method]]. This means that biologists must be able to show [[evidence]] for their ideas, and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves.

Biology attempts to answer questions such as:
"What are the characteristics of this living thing?" ([[comparative anatomy]]);
"How do the parts work?" ([[physiology]]);
"How should we group living things?" ([[Biological classification|classification]], [[taxonomy]]);
"What does this living thing do?" ([[behaviour]], [[growth]]);
"How does [[inheritance]] work? ([[genetics]]); "What has been the history of life?" ([[palaeontology]]). How do organisms relate to their [[environment]]? ([[ecology]]). All modern biology is influenced by [[evolution]], which answers the question: "How has the living world come to be as it is?"

'''Belgium''', officially the '''Kingdom of Belgium''', is a [[Federation|federal]] [[sovereign state|state]] in Western Europe. It is a founding member of the [[European Union]]. It has the headquarters of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]] and some other famous organisations. The [[capital city]] of Belgium is [[Brussels]].  Belgium has an area of {{convert|30528|km2|sqmi}}.  Around 11 million people live in Belgium.

There are three [[region]]s in Belgium: [[Flanders]] (where the people speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) in the northern half of Belgium, [[Wallonia]] (where the people speak [[French language|French]]) in the southern half, and the [[Brussels]]-Capital Region in the middle (where French is mostly spoken, with some Dutch).

The population is about 60% Dutch-speaking (''Flemish people''), 39% French-speaking (''Walloons'') and 1% German-speaking (so called ''Deutschbelgier'') on the border with [[Germany]]. To look after these groups, Belgium has a complicated system of government.

The name 'Belgium' comes from ''[[Gallia Belgica]]''.  This was a [[Roman province]] in the northernmost part of [[Gaul]].  Before Roman invasion in 100&nbsp;BC,  the ''[[Belgae]]'', a mix of [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples]], lived there.<ref> {{Cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire]] |author=Bunson, Matthew

The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into the northern [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] and the [[Southern Netherlands]].  Southern Netherlands were ruled by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and the [[Austria]]n [[Habsburg]]s.  This made up most of modern Belgium. 

After the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1794|campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars]], the Low Countries were added into the [[French First Republic]].  This ended Austrian rule in the area. Adding back the Low Countries formed the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]].  This happened at the end of the [[First French Empire]] in 1815.

The [[Belgian Revolution]] was in 1830. <ref name=Dobbelaere-VoyE> {{Cite journal |url = http://socrel.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/Special_Issue/S1.full.pdf |title = From Pillar to Postmodernity: The Changing Situation of Religion in Belgium |page = S1 |publisher = ([http://www-oxford.op.org/allen/about.htm The Allen Review]).

The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885 gave control of the [[Congo Free State]] to [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold&nbsp;II]]. This was for him personally and not for the country of Belgium.  Starting in about 1900 many people did not like how he treated the Congolese people. In 1908 the Belgian state took control of the colony.  It was then called the [[Belgian Congo]].<ref> {{Cite book |title=The State of Africa |pages=95–96(?) |edition=Hardcover 608pp |date=6 June 2005 |author=Meredith, Mark |publisher=Free Press

Germany invaded Belgium in 1914. This was part of World War&nbsp;I. The opening months of the war were very bad in Belgium. During the war Belgium took over the of [[Ruanda-Urundi]] (modern day [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]). After the First World War, the [[districts of Prussia|Prussian districts]] of [[Eupen-Malmedy|Eupen and Malmedy]] were added into Belgium in 1925. [[Battle of Belgium|The country was again invaded by Germany in 1940]] and under German control until 1944. After World War&nbsp;II, the people made king [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold&nbsp;III]] leave his throne in 1951. This is because they thought he helped the Germans.   

In 1960 the Belgian Congo stopped being under Belgian rule.<ref> {{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1304803 |title=The Congolese Civil War 1960–1964 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=29 April 2010 }}</ref> Two years later Ruanda-Urundi also became free. Belgium joined [[NATO]] as a founding member. 

== Government and Politics ==

Belgium has a system of [[government]] known as a [[constitutional monarchy]], meaning that it has a [[monarch]], but that the monarch does not rule the country, and that a government is elected [[Democracy|democratically]].

Belgium has had its own monarchy since 1831. King [[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]] left the throne on July 21, 2013 and the current king is [[Philippe of Belgium|Philippe]].

In Belgium, the government is elected. Between mid-2010 and late 2011, after no clear result in the [[election]], Belgium had no official government, until [[Elio Di Rupo]] became [[Prime Minister]]. [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]] both also have their own regional governments, and there is a notable independence movement in Flanders. [[Charles Michel]] is currently the Prime Minister.

== Geography ==
{{see also|List of cities in Belgium}}

Belgium is next to [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Its total area is 33,990 [[square kilometers]].  The land area alone is 30,528&nbsp;km². Belgium has three main geographical regions. The coastal plain is in the north-west. The central plateau are part of the Anglo-Belgian Basin. The [[Ardennes (forest)|Ardennes]] uplands are in the south-east. The Paris Basin reaches a small fourth area at Belgium's southernmost tip, Belgian Lorraine.

The coastal plain is mostly [[sand dune]]s and [[polder]]s. Further inland is a smooth, slowly rising landscape.  There are fertile [[valley]]s. The hills have many [[forest]]s. The [[plateau]]s of the Ardennes are more rough and rocky.  They have caves and small, narrow valleys. Signal de Botrange is the country's highest point at 694 metres (2,277&nbsp;ft).

===Provinces===
Belgium is divided into three Regions.  [[Flemish Region|Flanders]] and [[Walloon Region|Wallonia]] are divided into [[province]]s.  The third Region, [[Brussels Capital Region|Brussels]] is not part of any province.

The sculptor [[Panamarenko]] is still a remarkable figure in contemporary art.<ref>{{cite web|title=Belgian Artists: (biographies & artworks)|date=5 February 2006|publisher=World Wide Arts Resources|url=http://wwar.com/masters/nationalities/belgian.html|accessdate=10 May 2007}}—List of Belgian painters, linking to their biographies and artworks</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Baudson, Michel|title=Panamarenko|publisher=Flammarion (Paris), quoted at presentation of the ''XXIII Bienal Internacional de São Paulo''|year=1996|url=http://www1.uol.com.br/bienal/23bienal/universa/iueopa.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070207233008/http://www1.uol.com.br/bienal/23bienal/universa/iueopa.htm|archivedate=7 February 2007|accessdate=10 May 2007}}</ref> The artist [[Jan Fabre]] and the painter [[Luc Tuymans]] are other internationally known figures in contemporary art. 

Belgian contributions to architecture were also in the 19th and 20th centuries. [[Victor Horta]] and [[Henry van de Velde]] were major starters of the [[Art Nouveau]] style.<ref>{{cite web|title=ib.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, there were major violinists, such as [[Henri Vieuxtemps]], [[Eugène Ysaÿe]] and [[Arthur Grumiaux]]. [[Adolphe Sax]] invented the [[saxophone]] in 1846. The composer [[César Franck]] was born in Liège in 1822. Newer music in Belgium is also famous. Jazz musician [[Toots Thielemans]] and singer [[Jacques Brel]] have made global fame. In rock/pop music, [[Telex (band)|Telex]], [[Front 242]], [[K's Choice]], [[Hooverphonic]], [[Zap Mama]], [[Soulwax]] and [[Deus (band)|dEUS]] are well known. In the heavy metal scene, bands like [[Machiavel]], [[Channel Zero (band)|Channel Zero]] and [[Enthroned]] have a worldwide fan-base.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Timeline—A brief history of Belgian Pop Music|year=2007 |month=March|work=The Belgian Pop & Rock Archives|publisher=Flanders Music Centre, Brussels|url=http://houbi.com/belpop/timeline.htm

'''Brazil''' (officially called '''Federative Republic of Brazil'''; how to say: {{IPA2|bɾɐˈziw}}) is a [[country]] in [[South America]]. It is the [[earth|world]]'s fifth largest country. The country has about 209 million people. The [[capital (city)|capital]] of Brazil is [[Brasília]]. Brazil was named after [[brazilwood]]. Brazilwood is a tree that once grew very well along the Brazilian coast.<ref name="Fausto1999">{{cite book|author=Boris Fausto|title=A Concise History of Brazil|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HJdaM325m8IC&pg=PA9|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56526-4|page=9}}</ref>

== History ==
The first people to come to Brazil came around 9,000 B.C.{{cn}} That group of people is often called the South American Indians.  They probably came from [[North America]]. Some of them were hunters and gatherers, but others were farmers.<ref name="Britannica">{{citeweb|url=http://school.eb.com/levels/high/article/106094 |title=Brazil |website=Britannica School |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica |accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref>

[[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] was the first European to see Brazil. He saw it in 1500. He was from [[Portugal]] and the Portuguese government claimed Brazil. Soon, explorers explored the whole coastline of Brazil and colonies were set up. In the late 1500s and early 1600s the Dutch and the French would sometimes try to take land in Brazil. Brazilians started moving inland farther than the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] said they could. This caused some fights with the Spaniards and native people in the area.<ref name="Britannica" />

In 1822, Brazil claimed to be its own country and not a part of [[Portugal]] anymore. Soon there was [[civil war]]. But the emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] improved the economy, and in 1888, he freed the [[slavery|slaves]]. In 1889, there was a military [[coup]] and Pedro II had to leave the country.<ref name="Britannica" />

In 1889, Brazil became a [[republic]]. It was not very democratic, because the only people who could vote were people who owned land. There were some uprisings in the 1920s because some people thought the government was unfairly helping coffee growers. Brazil joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during [[World War II]].<ref name="Britannica" />

During the 1960s, the leader [[Castelo Branco]] made the government like a [[dictatorship]]. Since then, the country has become more democratic, but some people feel that there are still big problems in health and education.  Brazil will be hosting the 2016 olympics in Rio de Janeiro during August 5-21.

==Languages==
Most people in Brazil speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Brazil is the only country in Latin America that speaks [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

Some people in Brazil speak [[German language|German]] dialects. That came from German immigrants. 0.8% of Brazilians speak German as their [[first language]].

Other people in Brazil speak indigenous Brazilian languages, [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[French language|French]], or [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] and [[Aymara language|Aymará]] are the first languages of a small number of Brazilians.

== Geography ==
Brazil has the world's largest [[rainforest]], the [[Amazon Rainforest]]. It makes up 40% of the country's land area. Brazil also has other types of land, including a type of [[savanna]] called ''cerrado'', and a dry plant region named ''caatinga''.

The most important cities are [[Brasília]] (the capital), [[Belém (Brazil)|Belém]], [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Curitiba]], [[Florianópolis]], [[Fortaleza (Brazil)|Fortaleza]], [[Goiânia]], [[Manaus]], [[Porto Alegre]],  [[Recife]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[São Paulo]] (the biggest city) and [[Vitória (Brazil)|Vitória]].  Other cities are at [[List of largest cities in Brazil]].

Brazil is divided into 26 states plus the Federal District in five regions (north, south, northeast, southeast and centre-west):
*'''North''': Acre, Amazonas, Rondônia, Roraima, Pará, Amapá, Tocantins
*'''Northeast''': Maranhão, Pernambuco, Ceará, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia
*'''Centre-West''': Goiás, Mato grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Distrito Federal/ Federal District
*'''Southeast''': São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais
*'''South''': Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul

The country is the fifth largest in the world by area. It is known for its many rainforests and jungles. It is next to every country in South America except [[Chile]] and [[Ecuador]].

== People/culture ==

Brazil is the largest country in South America. Its people are called Brazilians or Brasileiros(In Brazilian Portuguese). The people include people of Portuguese or other European descent who mainly live in the South, Africans, Native Americans and people of Mixed ancestry. Brazil also has the largest Japanese community outside Japan.

[[Category:Portuguese-speaking countries]][[File:Chemicals in flasks.jpg|thumb|200px|Chemistry is the science of ''chemical elements'' and ''compounds''.]]
'''Chemistry''' is a branch of  [[science]] that deals with [[chemical element]]s and [[Chemical compound|compounds]], and how these things work together. It is the study of the [[material]]s (things) that make up our bodies and everything in the [[world]] around us.

==History==
Before 1600, people studied substances to figure out how to do things such as turn lead into gold, but no one managed to do that. This was called alchemy. Alchemists (people that did alchemy) did discover some useful things, though. Sulphuric acid and nitric acid were two substances that they discovered.
Only a few elements were known. Some of them are mercury, silver, gold, and carbon.

Chemistry began as a true science during the 1600s. This is when chemists discovered the simplest [[substance]]s that make up all other substances. These simple substances are called elements. One of the things that they learned is that gold and lead are two different elements, so you can not change one into the other by a chemical reaction. The first element discovered after 1600 was [[phosphorus]], a strange white glowing solid.

Elements were discovered more and more rapidly. People separated the air into many parts and isolated the [[noble gas]]es from it. They also processed special minerals from a mine in [[Sweden]] to get [[rare earth metal]]s. [[Radioactivity]] was also discovered. Today chemists have discovered 118 different elements. Some are very common, like [[oxygen]]. Many are very rare and expensive, like [[platinum]]. Some cannot be found on earth and can only be made in labs, like [[rutherfordium]].

Since the 1920s, the increased understanding of [[physics]] has changed chemists' [[theory|theories]] about [[chemical reaction]]s.  With smaller and faster [[computer]]s, chemists have built better tools for [[Analytical chemistry|analyzing]] substances. These tools have been sent to study chemicals on [[Mars]].  Police also use those tools to study [[evidence]] from [[crime]] [[wikt:scene|scene]]s.

==Types of chemistry==
There are several types of chemistry. [[Analytical chemistry]] looks at which  chemicals are in things. For example, looking at how much [[arsenic]] is in food. [[Organic chemistry]] looks at things that have [[carbon]] in them. For example, making [[acetylene]]. [[Inorganic chemistry]] looks at things that do not have carbon in them. One example is making an [[integrated circuit]].

A large area of chemistry is [[polymer chemistry]]. This looks at plastics. One example is making [[nylon]]. Because plastics are made of carbon, polymer chemistry is part of organic chemistry. Another area is [[biochemistry]]. This looks at the chemistry of living things. An example would be seeing how [[arsenic]] poisons people. Biochemistry is also part of organic chemistry. There are many other small branches of chemistry.                  

==[[wikt:concept|Concepts]] of chemistry==
===Basic concepts===
The basic unit of an [[Chemical element|element]] is called an [[atom]]. An atom is the smallest building block that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down (turning into a lighter element, for example through [[nuclear fission]] or [[radioactive decay]]). A [[chemical compound]] is a [[substance]] made up of two or more elements. In a compound, two or more atoms are joined together to form a [[molecule]]. The tiniest speck of dust or drop of [[liquid]], that one can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules. [[Mixture]]s are [[substance]]s where chemicals are mixed but not reacted. An example would be mixing sand and salt. This can be undone again to produce salt and sand separately. Chemical compounds are changed by a chemical reaction. An example would be heating [[sodium bicarbonate]], common baking soda. It will make water, [[carbon dioxide]], and [[sodium carbonate]]. This reaction cannot be undone.

===Mole===
A mole is a very large amount of atoms (602,214,150,000,000,000,000,000 atoms). The [[atomic mass]] of an element can be used to see how much of the element makes a mole. For example, the atomic mass of copper is about 63.55. That means about 63.55 [[gram]]s of copper metal has a mole of atoms. The atomic mass of chlorine is about 35.45. That means 35.45 grams of chlorine has a mole of atoms in it.

Moles can be used to see how many molecules are in chemical compounds, too. [[Copper(II) chloride]] is an example. CuCl<sub>2</sub> is its chemical formula. There is one copper atom (63.55) and two chlorine atoms (35.45 · 2 = 70.90). Add all the molar masses of the elements together to get the molar mass of the chemical compound (63.55 + 70.90 = 134.45). That means in 134.45 grams of copper(II) chloride, there is one mole of copper(II) chloride molecules. This concept is used to calculate how much chemicals are needed in a chemical reaction if no reactants (chemicals that are reacted) should be left. If too much reactant is used, there will be some reactants left in the chemical reaction.

===Acids and bases===
[[Acid]]s and [[base (chemistry)|bases]] are common chemicals. Acids release H<sup>+</sup> [[ion]]s when in water, and bases release [[Hydroxide|OH<sup>−</sup>]] ions when in water. Acids can react with bases. The H<sup>+</sup> ion is taken from the acid by the base. This makes water, H<sub>2</sub>O. A salt is also made when an acid and a base react together. An example would be reacting [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) and [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH). Hydrochloric acid releases H<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions in water. The base releases Na<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup> ions. The H<sup>+</sup> and the OH<sup>-</sup> react to make water. There is a solution of [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) left. Sodium chloride is a [[salt]]. 

==Usefulness==
Chemistry is very useful in everyday life and makes up the foundation of many branches of science. Most objects are made by chemists (people who do chemistry). Chemists are constantly working to find new and useful substances. Chemists make new [[Medicine|drugs]] and materials like [[paint]]s that we use every day.

==Safety==
[[File:Cyril Ponnamperuma analyzing a moon sample.jpg|thumb|200px|This chemist is wearing safety [[glasses]], a lab coat and [[glove]]s. He is looking at a rock from the [[moon]].]]
Many chemicals are harmless, but there are some chemicals that are dangerous. For example, [[mercury(II) chloride]] is very [[wikt:toxic|toxic]]. [[Chromate]]s can cause [[cancer]]. [[Tin(II) chloride]] pollutes water easily. [[Hydrochloric acid]] can cause bad burns. Some chemicals like [[hydrogen]] can explode or catch fire. To stay safe, chemists experiment with chemicals in a chemical lab. They use special equipment and clothing to do reactions and keep the chemicals contained. The chemicals used in [[Medicine|drugs]] and in things like [[bleach]] have been tested to make sure they are safe if used correctly.

{{disambig}}'''Computer science''' is the study of how to manipulate, manage, transform and [[encode]] [[information]]. 

There are many different areas in computer science. Some of the areas consider problems in an [[wikt:abstract|abstract]] way. Some areas need special [[machine]]s, called [[computer]]s.

A person who works with computers will often need [[mathematics]], [[science]], and [[logic]] in order to make and use computers.

== Common tasks for a computer scientist ==
=== Asking questions ===
This is so that they can find new and easier ways to do things, and the way to approach problems with this information.

=== Asking the right question ===
Computers can do some things easily (for example: simple math, or sorting out a list of names from A-to-Z). But computers cannot answer questions when there is not enough information, or when there is no real answer. Also, computers may take too much time to finish long [[wikt:task|tasks]]. For example, it may take too long to find the shortest way through all of the towns in the USA - so instead a computer will try to make a [[heuristic|close guess]]. A computer will answer these simpler questions much faster.

=== Answering the question ===
[[Algorithm]]s are complicating steps of instructions describing how to complete a task, such as solving a problem. Think about [[playing cards]], for example. A computer scientist wants to sort the cards. First he wants to sort them out by color. Then he wants to order them by number (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace). The computer scientist may see different ways to sort the playing cards. He must now think about how he will do it. When he decides, he has created an algorithm. After making the algorithm, the scientist needs to test whether the algorithm always does what it should. Then, the scientist can see how well his program sorts the cards.

A simple but very slow algorithm could be: drop the cards, pick them up, and check whether they are sorted. If they are not, do it again. This method will work, but it will often take a very long time.
 
A person may do this better by looking through all the cards, finding the first card (2 of diamonds), and putting it at the start. After this, he looks for the second card, and so on. This works much faster, and does not need much space. This sorting algorithm is a selection sort.

Computer science began during [[World War II]] and separated from the other sciences during the 1960s and 1970s. Now, computer science uses special methods of doing things, and has its own special words. It is related to [[electrical engineering]], [[mathematics]], and [[language science]].

Computer science looks at the [[theory|theoretical]] parts of computers. [[Computer engineering]] looks at the physical [[computer hardware|parts]] of computers (hardware), and [[software engineering]] looks at the use of [[software|computer programs]] and how to make them.

[[File:Desktop computer clipart - Yellow theme.svg|thumb|A drawing of a usual modern desktop computer.]]
A '''computer''' is a [[machine]] (mostly electronic) that is able to take information ([[Information|input]]), do some work on or make changes to the information (process), to make new information ([[output]]). Computers have existed for much of [[human]] [[history]]. Examples of early computers are the [[astrolabe]] and the [[abacus]].  There are four main processing steps in a computer, and they are: [[input device|inputting]], [[output device|outputting]], [[computer memory|storage]] and processing.

Modern computers are very different from early computers. They can do billions of calculations per second.  Most people have used a [[personal computer]] in their home or at work.  Computers do many different jobs where [[automation]] is useful.  Some examples are controlling [[traffic light]]s, [[vehicle]] computers, security systems, [[washing machine]]s and digital televisions.

A [[computer user]] can control it by a [[user interface]].  [[Input device]]s include [[keyboard (computer)|keyboard]], [[computer mouse|mouse]], buttons, [[touch screen]].  Some very new computers can also be controlled with voice commands or hand gestures or even brain signals through electrodes implanted in the brain or along nerves.

Computers can be designed to do almost anything with information.  Computers are used to control large and small machines which in the past were controlled by humans.  They are also in homes, where they are used for things such as listening to music, reading the [[news]], and writing.

Modern computers are electronic machines. A computer is only useful if it has both hardware and software.  Hardware is the physical parts the computer is made of - for example keyboard, mouse, screen, tower, and the circuits inside it.   Software is the computer programs (mathematical instructions). The software uses the hardware, when the user gives it instructions, and gives useful output.

Many modern computers do billions of calculations each second.   They do mathematical [[arithmetic]] very quickly but computers do not really "think".  They only follow the instructions in their software programs.

Computer programs are designed or written by computer [[programmer]]s. A few programmers write programs in the computer's own language called [[machine code]].   Most programs are written using a [[programming language]] like [[C++]], [[Java programming language|Java]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]].  These programming languages are more like the language you talk and write with every day. A program called a [[compiler]] translates the user's instructions into binary code (machine code) that the computer will understand and do what is needed.

== History of computers ==
[[File:Jacquard.loom.full.view.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Jacquard loom]] was one of the first programmable devices.]]

=== Definition ===
A computer is an electronic [[machine]] which helps in solving problems quickly and easily. It solves problems according to instructions given to it by the computer user called programs or software. It is a digital machine(that uses binary digits) used in all fields.

=== Automation ===
Humans have a problem with maths.  To show this, try doing 584 x 3,220 in your head.  It is hard to remember all the steps!  People made tools to help them remember where they were in a maths problem. The other problem people have is that they have to do the same problem over and over and over again. A [[cashier]] had to make change every day in her head or with a piece of paper. That took a lot of time and made mistakes. So, people made [[calculator]]s that did those same things over and over. This part of computer history is called the "history of automated calculation," which is a fancy phrase for "the history of machines that make it easy for me to do this same maths problem over and over without making mistakes."

The [[abacus]], the [[slide rule]],  the [[astrolabe]] and the [[Antikythera mechanism]] (which dates from about 150-100 BC) are examples of automated calculation machines.

=== Programming ===
{{main|Computer programming}}
Some people did not want a machine that would do the same thing over and over again. For example, a music box is a machine that plays the same music over and over again. Some people wanted to be able to tell their machine to do different things. For example, they wanted to tell the music box to play different music every time. They wanted to be able to program the music box- to order the music box to play different music. This part of computer history is called the "history of programmable machines" which is a fancy phrase for "The history of machines that I can order to do different things if I know how to speak their language."

One of the first examples of this was built by [[Hero of Alexandria]] (c. 10–70 AD). He built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting 10 minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums. These ropes and drums were the language of the machine- they told what the machine did and when. Some people argue that this is the first programmable machine.<ref>{{cite web

Historians disagree on which early machines are "computers". Many say the "castle clock", an [[astronomical clock]] invented by [[Al-Jazari]] in 1206, is the first known [[Computer programming|programmable]] [[analog computer]]. Others say the first computer was made by [[Charles Babbage]].<ref name="Ancient Discoveries">{{citation|title=Ancient Discoveries, Episode 11: Ancient Robots|publisher=History Channel|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxjbaQl0ad8|accessdate=2008-09-06}}</ref> [[Al - Jazari]]'s showed the [[zodiac]], the [[Heliocentric orbit|solar]] and [[lunar orbit]]s, a [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]]-shaped [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]] travelling across a gateway that made some [[door]]s to open every [[hour]],<ref>Howard R.

=== The Computing Era ===

At the end of the [[Middle Ages]], people in Europe thought math and [[engineering]] were more important. In 1623, [[Wilhelm Schickard]] made a mechanical calculator.  Other Europeans made more calculators after him.  They were not modern computers because they could only add, subtract, and multiply- you could not change what they did to make them do something like play Tetris.  Because of this, we say they were not programmable.

In 1801, [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] used [[punch card|punched paper cards]] to tell his [[loom|textile loom]] what kind of pattern to weave. He could use punch cards to tell the loom what to do, and he could change the punch cards, which means he could program the loom to weave the pattern he wanted.  This means the loom was programmable.

[[Charles Babbage]] wanted to make a similar machine that could calculate.   He called it "The Analytical Engine".<ref>Don't confuse the Analytical Engine with Babbage's [[difference engine]] which was a non-programmable mechanical calculator.</ref> Because Babbage did not have enough money and always changed his design when he had a better idea, he never built his Analytical Engine.

As time went on, computers got more and more popular.  And that stands out at the beginning. This is because people get bored easily doing the same thing over and over.  Imagine spending your life writing things down on index cards, storing them, and then having to go find them again.  The U.S. Census Bureau in 1890 had hundreds of people doing just that.  People got bored and frustrated, and would say, "There HAS to be an easier way to do this."  Then a clever person worked out how to make machines do a lot of the work. [[Herman Hollerith]] figured out how to make a machine that would automatically add up information that the Census bureau collected. The [[Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation]] (which later became [[IBM]]) made his machines, and everyone was happy. At least, they were happy until their machines broke down, got jammed, and had to be repaired. This is when the [[Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation]] invented tech support.

Because of machines like this, new ways of talking to these machines were invented, and new types of machines were invented, and eventually the computer as we know it was born.

=== Analog and Digital Computers ===

In the first half of the 20th century, scientists started using computers, mostly because scientists had a lot of math to figure out and wanted to spend more of their time thinking about the secrets of the universe instead of spending hours adding numbers together.  For example, if they had to launch a [[rocket ship]], they needed to do a lot of math to make sure the rocket worked right.

So they put together computers. These computers used [[analog signal|analog]] circuits, which made them very hard to program. Then, in the 1930s, they invented [[digital]] computers, which made them easier to program.

=== High-scale computers ===

Scientists figured out how to make and use digital computers in the 1930s and 1940s.  Scientists made a lot of digital computers, and as they did, they figured out how to ask them the right sorts of questions to get the most out of them.  Here are a few of the computers they built:

{{Early computer characteristics}}

[[File:EDSAC (10).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[EDSAC]] was one of the first computers that remembered what you told it even after you turned the power off.  This is called ([[von Neumann architecture|von Neumann]]) architecture.]]
* [[Konrad Zuse]]'s [[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] "Z machines". The [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] (1941) was the first working machine that used [[Binary numeral system|binary]] arithmetic.  Binary arithmetic means using "Yes" and "No." to add numbers together.  You could also program it.  In 1998 the Z3 was proved to be [[Turing complete]].  Turing complete means that it is possible to tell this particular computer anything that it is mathematically possible to tell a computer.  It is the world's first modern computer.
* The non-programmable [[Atanasoff–Berry Computer]] (1941) which used vacuum tubes to store "yes" and "no" answers, and [[regenerative capacitor memory]].
* The [[Harvard Mark I]] (1944), A big computer that you could kind of program.
* The U.S. Army's Ballistics Research Laboratory [[ENIAC]] (1946), which could add numbers the way people do (using the numbers 0 through 9) and is sometimes called the first general purpose [[Electronics|electronic]] computer (since [[Konrad Zuse]]'s [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] of 1941 used [[electromagnets]] instead of [[electronics]]). At first, however, the only way to reprogram ENIAC was by rewiring it.

Several developers of ENIAC saw its problems. They invented a way to for a computer to remember what they had told it, and a way to change what it remembered. This is known as "stored program architecture" or [[von Neumann architecture]]. [[John von Neumann]] talked about this design in the paper ''First Draft of a Report on the [[EDVAC]]'', distributed in 1945. A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored-program architecture started around this time.  The first of these was completed in [[Great Britain]]. The first to be demonstrated working was the [[University of Manchester|Manchester]] Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM or "Baby"), while the [[EDSAC]], completed a year after SSEM, was the first really useful computer that used the stored program design. Shortly afterwards, the machine originally described by von Neumann's paper—[[EDVAC]]—was completed but was not ready for two years.

Nearly all modern computers use the stored-program architecture. It has become the main [[concept]] which defines a modern computer. The technologies used to build computers have changed since the 1940s, but many current computers still use the von-Neumann architecture.

[[File:80486dx2-large.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Microprocessor]]s are miniaturized devices that often implement stored program [[CPU]]s.]]

In the 1950s computers were built out of mostly [[vacuum tube]]s.  [[Transistors]] replaced vacuum tubes in the 1960s because they were smaller and cheaper.   They also need less power and do not break down as much as vacuum tubes. In the 1970s, technologies were based on [[integrated circuit]]s. [[Microprocessor]]s, such as the [[Intel 4004]] made computers smaller, cheaper, faster and more reliable. By the 1980s, [[microcontroller]]s became small and cheap enough to replace mechanical controls in things like [[washing machine]]s. The 1980s also saw [[home computer]]s and [[personal computer]]s. With the evolution of the [[Internet]], personal computers are becoming as common as the [[television]] and the [[telephone]] in the household.

In 2005 Nokia started to call some of its mobile phones (the N-series) "multimedia computers" and after the launch of the Apple [[iPhone]] in 2007, many are now starting to add the [[smartphone]] category among "real" computers.  In 2008, if smartphones are included in the numbers of computers in the world, the biggest computer maker by units sold, was no longer Hewlett-Packard, but rather [[Nokia]].{{fact|date=December 2008}}

== Kinds of computers ==
There are six types of computers:  personal computers, mainframes, laptop computers, mini computers, super computers and embedded computers.

A "desktop computer" is a small machine that has a screen (which is not part of the computer).  Most people keep them on top of a desk, which is why they are called "desktop computers." "[[Laptop]] computers" are computers small enough to fit on your lap.  This makes them easy to carry around. Both laptops and desktops are called personal computers, because one person at a time uses them for things like playing music, surfing the web, or playing video games.

There are bigger computers that many people at a time can use.  These are called "Mainframes," and these computers do all the things that make things like the internet work. You can think of a personal computer like this:  the personal computer is like your skin:  you can see it, other people can see it, and through your skin you feel wind, water, air, and the rest of the world.  A mainframe is more like your internal organs: you never see them, and you barely even think about them, but if they suddenly went missing, you would have some very big problems.

An embedded computer, also called [[embedded system]] is a computer that does one thing and one thing only, and usually does it very well.  For example, an [[alarm clock]] is an embedded computer:  it tells the time.  Unlike your personal computer, you cannot use your clock to play Tetris.  Because of this, we say that embedded computers cannot be programmed, because you cannot install more programs on your clock.  Some [[mobile phone]]s, [[automatic teller machine]]s, [[microwave oven]]s, [[CD player]]s and [[car]]s are operated by embedded computers.

=== All-in-one PC ===
All-in-one computers are [[PC|desktop computers]] that have all of the computer's inner mechanisms in the same case as the [[Computer monitor|monitor]]. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has made several popular examples of all-in-one computers, such as the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] of the mid-1980s and the [[iMac]] of the late 1990s and 2000s.

== Common uses of home computers ==
* Playing [[computer game]]s
* [[Writing]]
* Solving [[mathematics]]
* [[search engine|Looking]] for things on the [[Internet]]
* Watching [[TV]] and [[movies]]
* Listening to [[music]]
* [[Communication|Communicating]] with other people
* Downloading
* Sending [[e-mail]]
* Sorting
* Recording
* Calculating
* Editing (Video, Photo)
* Taking Pictures ([[photography]])
* Drawing

== Common uses of work computers ==
* Word processing
* Spreadsheets
* PowerPoint Presentations
* Photo Editing (Photoshop, GIMP)
* E-mail
* Video editing/rendering/encoding
* Audio recording
* System Management

== Working methods ==
Computers store data and the instructions as numbers, because computers can do things with numbers very quickly. These data are stored as [[binary]] [[symbol]]s (1s and 0s). A 1 or a 0 symbol stored by a computer is called a [[bit]], which comes from the words binary [[Numerical digit|digit]]. Computers can use many bits together to represent [[Instruction (computer science)|instructions]] and the data that these instructions use. A list of instructions is called a [[computer program|program]] and is stored on the computer's [[hard disk]]. Computers work through the program by using a [[central processing unit]], and they use fast memory called [[RAM]] as a space to store the instructions and data while they are doing this. When the computer wants to store the results of the program for later, it uses the [[hard disk]] because things stored on a hard disk can still be remembered after the computer is turned off.

An [[operating system]] tells the computer how to understand what jobs it has to do, how to do these jobs, and how to tell people the results.  Millions of computers may be using the same [[operating system]], while each computer can have its own [[application program]]s to do what its user needs.  Using the same [[operating system]]s makes it easy to learn how to use computers for new things.  A user who needs to use a computer for something different, can learn how to use a new application program.  Some [[operating system]]s can have simple command lines or a fully user-frendly [[GUI]].

== The Internet ==
One of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with [[communication]]. Communication is how people share [[information]]. Computers have helped people move forward in [[science]], [[medicine]], [[business]], and [[learning]], because they let experts from anywhere in the world work with each other and share information. They also let other [[wikt:people|people]] communicate with each other, do their jobs almost anywhere, learn about almost anything, or share their opinions with each other. The [[Internet]] is the thing that lets [[wikt:people|people]] communicate between their computers.

== Computers and waste ==
A computer is now almost always an [[electronic device]].  It usually contains materials that will become [[toxic waste]] when disposed of.  When a new computer is bought in some places, laws require that the cost of its [[waste management]] must also be paid for.  This is called [[product stewardship]].

Computers can become [[wikt:obsolete|obsolete]] quickly, depending on what programs the user runs.  Very often, they are thrown away within two or three years, because newer programs require a more powerful computer. This makes the problem worse, so [[computer recycling]] happens a lot.  Many projects try to send working computers to [[developing nation]]s so they can be re-used and will not become waste as quickly, as most people do not need to run new programs. Some computer parts, such as [[hard drive]]s, can break easily. When these parts end up in the [[landfill]], they can put [[poison]]ous chemicals like [[lead]] into the ground water. Hard drives can also contain secret information like [[credit card]] numbers. If the hard drive is not erased before being thrown away, an [[Identity theft|identity thief]] can get the information off of the hard drive, even if the drive doesn't work, and use it to steal money from the previous owner's bank account.

== Main hardware ==
Computers come in different forms, but most of them have a common design.
* All computers have a [[CPU]].
* All computers have some kind of [[data bus]] which lets them get inputs or output things to the environment.
* All computers have some form of memory. These are usually chips ([[integrated circuit]]s) which can hold information.
* Many computers have some kind of sensors, which lets them get input from their environment.
* Many computers have some kind of display device, which lets them show output. They may also have other [[peripheral equipment|peripheral devices]] connected.
 	
A computer has several main parts. When comparing a computer to a human body, the [[CPU]] is like a brain. It does most of the 'thinking' and tells the rest of the computer how to work. The CPU is on the Motherboard, which is like the skeleton. It provides the basis for where the other parts go, and carries the [[nerves]] that connect them to each other and the CPU. The motherboard is connected to a power supply, which provides [[electricity]] to the entire computer. The various drives ([[compact disc|CD]] drive,  [[floppy drive]], and on many newer computers, [[USB flash drive]]) act like eyes, ears, and fingers, and allow the computer to read different types of storage, in the same way that a human can read different types of books. The [[hard drive]] is like a human's memory, and keeps track of all the data stored on the computer. Most computers have a [[sound card]] or another method of making sound, which is like [[vocal cords]], or a voice box. Connected to the sound card are [[computer speaker|speakers]], which are like a mouth, and are where the sound comes out. Computers might also have a [[graphics card]], which helps the computer to create visual effects, such as 3D environments, or more realistic colors, and more powerful graphics cards can make more realistic or more advanced images, in the same way a well trained artist can.

== Alternative versions ==
=== Australia ===
Some sources say that Australia is one of the seven continents.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/as.html#Geo World fact book - Australia]</ref> Others say that Australia is part of [[Oceania]].   [[Oceania]] is a region which includes [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[Pacific Islands]].<ref>[http://worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/au.htm Worldatlas.com - Australia]</ref> The third alternative is the term [[Australasia]], which includes at least all countries on the Australian [[continental plate]]. This includes the islands of [[New Guinea]], [[Tasmania]], New Zealand and a number of smaller islands. It is on the south-eastern side of the [[Wallace Line]], with distinct differences in its biology from the Asian side of the line.

:"It includes all the islands of the Malay Archipelago... as well as the various groups of islands in the Pacific. The term has been used in very different senses".<ref>Wallace, Alfred Russel 1893. ''Australasia'', vol 1. London: Stanford. Chapter 1: Definition.</ref>

=== North and South America ===
North America and South America are often described as "the Americas". This has the advantage of including [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]] islands. Otherwise, Central America is counted as part of North America.

=== Eurasia ===
[[Eurasia]] is not really an alternative, it is a recognition that the landmass of Europe and Asia are continuous, and some of its largest countries are in both continents. [[Russia]] extends from eastern Europe to the far east of Asia without a break. The [[Ural Mountains]], which run roughly north/south, are the traditional dividing-line between Europe and Asia. For many purposes it is convenient to consider the great landmass as a single continent, Eurasia.

When [[Britain|British]] people talk about "the Continent" (or "Continental" things) they mean the [[Europe|European mainland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/continent.html |title=Encarta World English Dictionary |accessdate=2008-08-05 |year=2007|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc.|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwRKDyZ6|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}</ref> This meaning is not used as much as it used to be, but is still seen in phrases like "Continental [[breakfast]]" ([[bread|rolls]] with [[cheese]], [[jam]] etc. as distinct from an "English breakfast" which is a cooked breakfast).

Continents not only move but also sometimes move against each other. The Indian subcontinent has been colliding with the Eurasian continent for a while now. As these continents push against each other, they buckle and bend. Because of this, the [[Himalaya Mountains]], where [[Mount Everest]] is, are still being made today.<ref name=holt>{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Earth Science| publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston| date = 2001| location = United States of America| pages = 211| url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-03-055667-8}}</ref>

[[Category:Geology]][[Image:Four elements representation.png|thumb|The four classical elements.]]

The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] '''classical elements''' are fire, air, water, and earth. In Greek [[philosophy]], [[science]] and [[medicine]], these make up a whole.

*Fire is both hot and dry.
*Air is both hot and wet.
*Water is both cold and wet.
*Earth is both cold and dry.

The image below has two squares on top of each other. The corners of one are the classical elements. The corners of the other are the properties.

[[Galen]] said these elements were used by [[Hippocrates]] to describe the human body. The elements are linked to the four humours: phlegm (water), yellow bile (fire), black bile (earth), and blood (air).

In [[China|Chinese]] [[Taoism]] the elements are [[metal]], [[wood]], [[water]], [[fire]], [[earth]] ({{lang|zh|金、木、水、火、土}}).

'''China''' ({{zh|t=中國;|s=中国}} [[Pinyin]]: Zhōngguó) is a [[Culture|cultural]] [[region]], an [[Ancient history|ancient]] [[civilization]], and a [[nation]] in [[East Asia]].

The last [[Chinese Civil War]] (1927-1949) resulted in two different political powers today, even though both governments agree they are one nation:
* {{flagicon|China}} The ''[[People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] ''(since 1949), commonly known as ''China'', has control over [[mainland China]] and the largely self-governing territories of [[Hong Kong]] (since 1997) and [[Macau]] (since 1999).
* {{flagicon|Taiwan}} The ''[[Republic of China|Republic of China (ROC)]] ''(since 1912), commonly known as ''[[Taiwan]]'', has control over the islands of [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Fujian|Kinmen]], and Matsu.

China has one of the world's oldest civilizations and has the oldest continuous civilization.<ref>http://www.emsc.nysed.gov/ciai/socst/grade3/whatisa.html</ref> It has [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence over 5,000 years old.<ref name="Hagg">Haggett, Peter.

==Origins==

== History ==
{{Main|History of China}}

=== Ancient (2100 B.C. - 1500 A.D.) ===
[[Ancient China]] was one of the first [[civilization]]s and was active since the [[2nd millennium BC]] as a [[feudalism|feudal]] [[society]]. Chinese civilization was also one of the few to invent [[writing]],<ref name="Hagg" /> with the others being [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley civilization]], the [[Maya civilization]], the [[Minoan civilization]] of [[ancient Greece]], and [[Ancient Egypt]].<ref>Gernet, Jacques. [1996] (1996). A history of Chinese civilization Edition 2, illustrated. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-49781-7, 9780521497817. p 40.</ref> It reached its golden age during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (c. A.D. 10th century).  Home of  [[Confucianism]] and [[Daoism]], it had great influence on nearby countries including Japan, Korea, and Vietnam in the areas of political system, philosophy, religion, art, and even writing and literature. China is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world. Statues and pottery, as well as decorations made of [[jade]], are some classic examples.

Before the [[Qin Dynasty]] united China, there were hundreds of small states that fought each other for hundreds of years in a war to control China. This is known as the [[Warring States Period]]. Although the continuing wars made people suffer, it was at this time when many great philosophies were born, including [[Confucianism]] and [[Daoism]]. Confucianism and Daoism alone have been the foundation of many social values seen in modern eastern-Asian cultures today.

Its geography mostly looked like that of modern China, except with northern and western edges that varied. It was often attacked by northern [[nomadic people]] such as the Turkics, the [[Mongol]]s lead by [[Genghis Khan]], and [[Kublai Khan]]. During the history of ancient China, the northern nomadic people and the Chinese people had been fighting each other and taking turns to rule the land and the people of China. However, when the northern people beat the Chinese people and came to rule the kingdom, they also Incorporated the Chinese way of living and became like the Chinese. Many of the strongest dynasties of China were ruled by the northern people, including the [[Qing Dynasty|Qin]], [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] (Mongolian), and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]]. Each time, they also brought new elements into the Chinese culture.

=== A new age ===

While China achieved many things in the [[First millennium]] and early [[2nd millennium]], it became an [[isolationism|isolationist]] country in the [[15th century|15th century C.E.]] This was because Spain found enormous silver in the new continent, which was the main currency (money) in China and Europe at the time, and China did not want to be bought by the foreigners.

By the time of the [[Renaissance]], European powers started to take over other countries in Asia.  While China was never actually taken over, many [[Europe]]an [[countries]], such as [[Britain]] and [[France]] built [[spheres of influence]] in China.  Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few [[centuries]], by the [[Qing Dynasty]], it had fallen behind other countries in [[technology]], and was helpless to stop this from happening.  This had become clear when it lost the [[Opium Wars]] to [[Britain]] in the [[19th century]].

In 1911, the Republic of China was founded by [[Sun Yat-sen]], but its government was very weak. [[Warlord]]s controlled many areas. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] led wars against them, and he became President and dictator.

In 1931, Japan invaded [[Manchuria]], a place in the northeastern part of China. On July 7, 1937, the Japanese attacked the rest of the country, starting what was called the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The war later became part of [[World War II]]. The war was fought for eight years and millions of Chinese people were killed.

However, the [[Chinese Civil War]] later started between the [[Kuomintang]] (Nationalists) of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) and the Communists of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Communists wanted to make China like the Soviet Union, whereas the other side wanted to keep China in its current state at the time. The Communists were led by [[Mao Zedong]], [[Liu Shaoqi]] and others. Later Liu lost influence with Mao and his death to this day remains unresolved. The Communists eventually won the war. The Nationalists (led by Chiang Kai-shek) fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in Taipei. After the Chinese Civil War, the Communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country, the People's Republic of China (PRC), in Beijing on October 1, 1949.

Under Mao the country stayed poor while Taiwan became richer. His attempt at [[industrialization]] and collectivization with the [[Great Leap Forward]] led to the deaths of many people from [[famine]]. The [[Cultural Revolution]] caused great social upheaval.  After 1976, China underwent [[market economy]] reforms under [[Deng Xiaoping]], and experienced rapid economic growth.  China is now one of the largest economies in the world, relying mainly on exports.

In recent history, China has had problems with protests, blocking of information on the [[Internet]], and [[censorship]] of news. 1989 was notable for the controversial Tian An Men Massacre.

== Culture ==
China is the origin of Eastern [[martial art]]s, called [[Kung-fu|Kung Fu]] or its first name [[Wushu]]. China is also the home of the well-respected [[Spa Monastery]] and [[Wudang Mountains]]. Martial art started more for the purpose of [[survival]], defense, and [[war]]fare than [[art]]. Over time some [[art form]]s have branched off, while others have retained their distinct Chinese flavor.

China has had renowned [[artist]]s including [[Wong Fei Hung]] ([[Huang Fei Hung]] or [[Hwang Fei Hung]]) and many others. [[Art]] has also co-existed with a variety of [[paint]]s including the more standard 18 colors. Legendary and controversial moves like [[Big Mak]] are also praised and talked about within the [[culture]].

China has many traditional [[festival]]s, such as Spring Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-autumn Festival and so on. The most significant is [[Chinese New Year]]. People in China will have holidays to celebrate these festivals.

=== Festivals ===
Spring Festival is the [[Chinese New Year]].  

Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet of the State of Chu during the [[Warring States]] period. He persuaded his emperor not to accept Qin's diplomats' offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him. He was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life. The people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse. They made and threw rice dumplings into the river. They hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poet's corpse. They also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish. Such practices, eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races, become what Chinese do in this festival nowadays.

Held on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, Mid-Autumn Festival is a festival for families. Now when the festival sets in, people would sit together to eat moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon, celebrate the bumper harvest and enjoy the family love and happiness. To the Chinese people, the full moon symbolizes family reunion, as does the "moon cakes." Hence the Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the Family Reunion Festival.

In [[geography]] and [[politics]], a '''country''' is a [[political division]]. It is often a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] [[territory]]. The term is most commonly used for both [[state]] and [[nation]], and also with [[government]]. For example, [[Liechtenstein]] is a country. The [[United Nations]] recognises lots of countries. There are around 206 countries in the World with 193 that are members of the [[UN]].

'''Colchester''' is a [[town]] in the northern part of the [[England|English]] [[Counties of England|county]] of [[Essex]]. It has a [[population]] of 104,000 people. People believe that Colchester is the oldest [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] town in England.

== History ==
Before Roman times, Colchester was ''Camulodunon''. This is a [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] name that came from [[Camulos]]. Camulos was the [[Celt]]ic [[deity|god]] of [[war]]. The Romans called Colchester ''Camulodunum'' (written "CAMVLODVNVM"). Colchester was attacked and burnt by [[Boudicca]] in [[61]] AD.

The church at the [[Benedictine]] [[abbey]] of [[John the Baptist|Saint John the Baptist]] was destroyed in [[1539]]. This was when King [[Henry VIII]] took the property of the Roman Catholic institutions in England. The only part left is a gate that people still go to visit.

King [[Cunobelinus]] (or "Cunobelin") was from Colchester.

'''Cartography''' is making [[map]]s. Cartography is part of [[geography]].
How people make maps is always changing. In the past, maps were drawn by hand, but today most printed maps are made using [[computer]]s. Someone who makes maps is called a cartographer.

Making a map can be as simple as drawing a direction on a napkin, or as complicated as showing a [[census]] of a whole country. Anyone can make a map, but there are people who spend their lives learning how to make complicated maps.

For many centuries maps were usually carefully [[Drawing|drawn]] onto a piece of paper. The reason they look old is that they have been much used or have been treated roughly.

Nowadays they are made on a [[computer]] which makes them look neater with accurate images.

[[Category:Cartography| ]]A '''Creator''' is a person who [[create]]s something.

In some [[religion]]s ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]]) [[God]] (or [[Allah]] meaning '''the God''' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) is the most important and original '''Creator''' of the whole [[Universe]] - including [[Human|Man]] who is made "in his image" (see [[Genesis]]) to [[Astronomy|observe]] it and [[control]] it like God. The idea that anything that a person is [[creating]], like an [[idea]], can be [[ownership|owned]] as [[property]] comes from the [[ethical tradition]]s and [[legal code]]s that came from these religions.

In other traditions ([[Buddhism]], [[Native American mythology]]) anyone has this potential for creating, and can become part of the greater creating of the [[universe]]. {{fact|date=January 2013}}[[Stewardship]] of home, [[Ecological footprint|land and all of Earth]] is a test for participating in this, or just good sense.

[[Category:Theology]]A '''contact network''' is a group of people who can all quickly get in touch with each other.  It does not guarantee any kind of help or access to [[knowledge]] other than that.

A [[creative network]], [[social network]] and [[power network]] are also contact networks.  These include some kind of guarantee or expectation of help.  Thus they involve more investment per person.

'''Chorizo''' is a [[pork]] (pig-meat) [[sausage]] which people first made in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. It is made with large pieces of fatty pork, [[chili pepper]] and [[paprika]]. The special taste of this sausage comes from the mild Spanish paprika in it. 

In the western hemisphere, the [[Mexico|Mexican]] and [[Caribbean]] types are better known. These types of chorizo are made with smaller pieces of pork and different seasonings and peppers are used.

Cured smoked chorizo can be [[Eating|eaten]] without [[cooking]]. Fresh chorizo must be cooked before eating. It can be eaten by its self, or as part of [[meal]]. It can also be used in place of ground [[beef]] or pork.

[[Category:Sausage]]'''Creativity''' is the [[ability]] of a person or group to make something new and useful or valuable, or the [[process]] of making something new and useful or valuable. It happens in all areas of life - science, art, literature and music. As a personal ability it is very difficult to [[measure]]. The reason is that we don't understand the mental processes that help some people be more creative than others. Judging what is creative is also controversial. Some people say only things which are historically new are creative, while other people say that if it is new for the creator and the people around them, then it is also creativity.

Some think creativity is an important thing that makes [[human]]s different from [[ape]]s. Others recognize that even apes, other [[primates]], other [[mammal]]s and some birds [[adapt]] to [[survive]] by being creative (for example - primates using tools). [[Liane Gabora]] believes that all [[culture]] comes from creativity, not [[imitation]]. Therefore, these people say, [[human science]] should focus on it (pay special attention to it): [[Ethics]] for example would focus on finding creative [[solution]]s to [[ethical dilemma]]s. [[Politics]] would focus on the [[political virtues]] that need some creativity. Imitation would not be the focus of [[education]]. [[Linguistics]] might be more interested in how new words are created by culture, rather than in how existing ones are used in [[grammar]].

[[Intellectual interests]] (recognized as [[intellectual rights]] or [[intellectual property]] in the [[law]]) are a way to [[reward]] creativity in law, but they do not always work very well. A good example is [[copyright]] which is supposed to pay [[author]]s and [[artist]]s, but may only pay [[lawyer]]s to make (imitative) arguments in [[court]].

Creativity is a central question in [[economics]], where it is known as '''ingenuity''' (the ability to come up with new ideas) or '''individual capital''' - [[capacity|capacities]] that [[individual]]s have, that do not arise from simple imitation of what is known already. This is separate from the [[instructional capital]] that might try to [[capture]] some of that in a [[patent]] or [[training]] system that helps others do what the individual leader or [[wikt:founder|founder]] of the system can do. In [[urban economics]] there are various ways to measure creativity - the [[Bohemian Index]] and [[Gay Index]] are two attempts to do this [[wikt:accurate|accurately]] and [[predict]] the [[economic growth]] of [[city|cities]] based on creativity.

[[File:Cathars expelled.JPG|thumb|right|The cathars are expelled from [[Carcassonne]], in the year 1209]]
[[File:Château de Peyrepertuse - Enceinte basse et éperon (est).jpg|thumb|right|The lower, older part of Castle [[Peyrepertuse]]. This castle was one of the last Cathar strongholds to fall]]

The '''Cathar''' [[wikt:faith|faith]] was a version of [[Christianity]]. They were usually considered [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]]. The word 'Cathar' comes the Greek word ''katharos'' meaning 'unpolluted' (from Tobias Churton, ''The Gnostics'') or  "the pure ones".

== Principles ==
The Cathars believed that the world had been made by a bad god.  They believed that this bad god had taken them from the good god and put them in the world, but inside their bodies there was a spirit, and that spirit needed to return to the good god.  They were famous for a belief in a form of [[reincarnation]] and believed that when someone died the bad god would put that person's spirit in a new body. They believed this cycle of coming back to life could be escaped by a ritual cleansing.  They were opposed to the doctrine of [[sin]].  

[[Women]] were prominent in the faith.  They were [[pacifist]]s.  They didn't eat anything that was made from other animals, including meat and [[milk|cows milk]]. The only [[wikt:exception|exception]] to this was [[fish]]. Fish was OK to eat because they believed fishes were not alive but just things that were sometimes produced from dirt and water.

They preached tolerance of other faiths.  They rejected the usual Christian rules of [[marriage]] and only believed in the New Testament.  An earlier 10th century Bulgarian heresy, [[Bogomilism]] and also [[Manichaeism]] started some of these trends.  

=== Language ===
They used a bible in the language people spoke. Many other Christians used a Bible in [[Latin language|Latin]]. Latin was spoken only by the [[priest]]s.

== Problems ==
In 1145, open challenge to Catholic dominance began.  In about 1165, the first Cathars said that the Church was "full of ravening (starving) wolves and hypocrites" and "worshipping the wrong God", right in front of the most powerful Catholics. In 1166, the [[Council of Oxford]] in [[England]] wiped out the English Cathars.  It was also suppressed in Northern France.  In 1167, Cathar [[bishop]]s met to discuss organizing a counter Church - in the South of France, the Languedoc nobles protected it, and many noble women became "Perfects".  Parish clergy had low [[morale]], or confidence.

=== Reactions ===
The [[Catholic Church]] was against Catharism, seeing it as a heresy.

In the South of France there was tremendous [[religious fervor]], and an [[economy]] that was starting to grow, and a social class of  [[merchant]]s and  [[peasant]]s was starting to grow.  Peasants owned their own [[land]].  Meanwhile, in other parts of [[Europe]], peasants were forced to give up their land to [[noble]]s and become [[serf]]s or [[slave]]s - the system of [[feudalism]].  There was a strong central [[absolute monarchy]] that did not exist in the South of France.  The [[burgher]]s and [[banker]]s had more power in this looser system.  [[R. I. Moore]] is a historian who believes that it was desire to crush this system and take over the land that drove the attack.

However, there was real cultural and religious difference to cause problems:  [[Troubador]]s, who combined some of the traditions of the [[Bard]]s of the [[Celt]]s, and [[Jew]]s, were both part of the multicultural society in the South of [[France]].  Their influences were not appreciated by local or Roman Church figures.  The 12th century Roman Catholic [[Monk]]s were founding their [[monastery|monasteries]] outside the towns, drawing the best people there.

=== Results ===
The Cathars thus had little competition.  The Cathar "Perfects", the so-called Good Men or Good Women, lived restrained lives and spread their faith in towns - where the Catholics in general did not have their best agents.  Also, Cathars preached that only these Good leaders had to follow the regimens their whole lives - lay people could repent only on their deathbeds.  Many 20th century [[Christian sect]]s have similar beliefs.

== The Albigensian Crusade ==
=== Methods ===
The Pope ordered a crusade against the Cathars in southern France.  He said any crusader who answered the call would be given the same rewards as a crusader who went to the Holy Land.  This was an [[absolution]] of all sin.

In the [[Launguedoc]], on the 22nd of July 1209, a force of about 30,000 [[Crusader]]s arrived at the walls of Beziers bearing the cross pattee to mislead and create ease among the Cathars, thinking they were friend, not foe, and  demanded that about 200 Cathars be surrendered.  The people of the town who were mostly Catholic, said that rather than turn over their friends and family, "we would rather be [[flaying|flayed alive]]."  

A mistake by the defenders of [[Beziers]] let thousands of attackers in. Arnauld Amaury made the famous quote "Kill them all, god knows his own"  on being asked how to tell who were Cathars during the assault. Everyone in the town was killed, some while taking refuge in the church.  It is guessed that 20,000 were killed, many of whom were Catholics and not Cathars at all.  The crusade became known as the '''[[Albigensian crusade]]''' after the town of [[Albi]].  It was to wipe out the Cathars almost entirely over forty or so years.  The Crusaders wanted to go home, but were ordered by the Pope to continue until the whole South of France was controlled and all Cathars were dead. In 1210, they attacked the fortress at [[Minerv]] and built "the first great bonfire of heretics" - beginning the practice of [[Pyre|burning at the stake]] that would continue in the [[Inquisition]] of the [[Counter-Reformation]]. It is interesting to note that at the siege of Montsegur when the fires were lit the Cathars ran down the hill and threw themselves on, as their beliefs were very strong.

===Result===
Catharism disappeared from the northern Italian cities after the 1260s, pressured by the Inquisition. The last known Cathar perfectus in the Languedoc, [[Guillaume Bélibaste]], was killed in 1321.

Modern cosmology is dominated by the [[Big Bang]] theory, which brings together observational astronomy and [[particle physics]].<ref>http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cosmology</ref> 

Though the word ''cosmology'' is recent (first used in 1730 in [[Christian Wolff]]'s ''Cosmologia Generalis''), the study of the universe has a long history.

==History==
Until recently, people thought that the [[universe]] was the [[Milky Way]]. They thought this because they could only see the planets up to [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]] and [[star]]s. With the invention of the [[telescope]], our universe got bigger. Even in the 20th century, people thought that the Milky Way was the universe. With the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], people could see things far away.

[[File:Brazil.Brasilia.01.jpg|thumb|[[Brasilia]] Cathedral]]
A '''church''' is a [[building]] that was constructed to allow people to meet to [[worship]] together. These people are usually [[Christianity|Christians]], or influenced by Christianity. Some other religious groups also call their religious buildings churches.<ref>Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: 2006 - Page 252</ref><ref>An Introduction to the Unitarian and Universalist Traditions - Page 128, 2011</ref>

Depending on the number of people that are in a community, the churches come in different sizes. Small churches are called [[chapel]]s. The churches in a particular geographical area form a group called the [[diocese]].  Each diocese has a [[cathedral]].  In most cases, the cathedral is a very big church. Cathedrals are the seat of [[bishop]]s.

In the [[Early Christianity|early days of Christianity]] people had to worship in secret. Christian worship was not allowed in the [[Roman empire]], so Christians had to meet in a secret place. Sometimes they met in people’s houses or barns, sometimes they met underground. The first places that were built for Christian worship were small chapels that were cut into a rock where people could worship without being discovered.

After the death of the Roman emperor [[Constantine I (Rome)|Constantine]] in [[337]] A.D. Christians were allowed to have buildings to worship in. These first churches were built on a similar plan to Roman [[basilica]]s. This plan was later used for the fine [[Gothic]] cathedrals and churches that were built at the end of the [[Middle Ages]].

== The parts of a church ==
{{further|List of church architecture terms}}

There are several parts in the architecture of a church. Not all churches will have all these parts:

* The '''[[nave]]''' is the main part of the church where the congregation (the people who come to worship) sit. 
* The '''aisles''' are the sides of the church which may run along the side of the nave.
* The '''transept''', if there is one, is an area which crosses the nave near the top of the church. This makes the church shaped like a cross, which is a symbol of the belief that [[Jesus]] died on the [[crucifix|cross]].
* The '''chancel''' leads up to the [[altar]] at the top of the church. The altar is in the '''sanctuary'''. The word “[[sanctuary]]” means “sacred place”. People were not allowed to be [[arrest]]ed in the sanctuary, so they were safe. The altar is usually at the [[east]] end of the church. People in the church sit facing the altar. We say that the church “faces east”.
* Churches will also have a '''tower''' or [[steeple]], usually at the west end. If the church has a transept the tower may be above the centre of the transept.

In Roman Catholic churches there is always a stoup (bowl) of [[holy water]] near the entrance of the church. This tradition comes from the fact that Roman [[basilica]]s had a fountain for washing in front of the entrance. The [[font]] is a bowl where people (often babies) are [[baptism|baptized]]. This is also near the entrance of the church. This is a symbol of the fact that it is welcoming the people into the Christian church.

Traditionally the nave has long [[bench]]es for the congregation to sit on. These are called '''pews'''. Some churches may now have replaced their pews with chairs so that they can be moved about for different occasions. At the front of the nave is the '''pulpit''' where the priest [[preach]]es (these talks are called “[[sermon]]s”). There is also a [[lectern]] (like a large [[music stand]]) from where the lessons (the [[Bible]] readings) are read.

If there are aisles along the side of the nave there will be [[column|pillars]] which hold up the roof. In large churches or cathedrals there may be a row of little arches along the top of these pillars. This is called the '''triforium'''. Over the triforium is the '''clerestory''' which is a row of windows high up in the church wall.

The chancel is the most holy part of the church, and this is why it is often separated from the nave by a screen which can be made of wood or stone, or occasionally iron. The congregation can see through the screen. On the top of the screen there may be a cross. This is called a rood (pronounce like “rude”) screen. Priests used to climb up a staircase to the top of the rood screen to read the [[epistle]] and the [[gospel]]. Sometimes people sang from there.

Inside the chancel are the benches where the [[Choir (music)|choir]] sit. These are called '''choir stalls'''. They are on both sides. The two sides of the choir sit facing one another. The choir members who sit on the left (north side) are called “cantoris” (the side where the “[[Cantor (church)|cantor]]” sits) and those on the right (south side) are called “decani” (the side where the [[deacon]] sits). In some large churches or cathedrals the seats for the priests tip up. The top of these seats, when they are tipped up, are called '''misericords''' (from the Latin word for “mercy”). This is because the priests or monks were able to lean against them when they got tired if they had to stand up for a long time.

Sometimes there are holes in the walls of the screen so that the congregation can see through. These are called '''squints'''. If there is a recess in the wall it is called an '''aumbry'''. It is a cupboard for [[Eucharist|communion]] [[wine]] that has been blessed by a priest.

The altar may be right at the east end of the church, but in larger churches or cathedrals it is often much farther forward. In that case the very east end is called an '''apse'''. Sometimes it is a separate chapel called the “Lady Chapel”.

== Churches through the ages ==

The design of churches changed a lot during the course of history. Often churches were made bigger. When this happened there may be a mixture of architectural styles. These styles vary a lot in different countries.

=== English churches ===

In [[England|English]] churches there were several different periods of architecture:

* The [[Saxon architecture|Saxon]] period ([[7th century|700]]-[[1050]]) was a time when churches were very simple. The end of the church (end of the sanctuary) was often rounded. Hardly any are left now because they were mostly made of [[wood]].
* The [[Norman architecture|Norman]] period ([[1050]]-[[1190]]) came from the style called [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] which was popular in Europe. The arches had ornaments which were called “mouldings”. The tops of the pillars looked like [[cushion]]s, so they were called “cushion capitals”. The windows were narrow and rounded at the top.
* [[Early English architecture|Early English]] or [[Gothic architecture]] ([[1190]]-[[1280]]) was not as solid and heavy as Norman architecture. Towers were elegant and tall, like the tower of [[Salisbury Cathedral]].
* The [[Decorated architecture|Decorated]] style of architecture ([[1280]]-[[1360]])was popular at a time when the [[plague]] (Black Death) was raging and a third of the people in England died. For that reason, not so much building was done then. There were lots of stone carvings were made in churches at that time.
* The [[Perpendicular architecture|Perpendicular]] style ([[1360]]-[[1540]]) was very grand. It had lots of straight upward lines and [[fan vaulting]]. This can be seen in [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]]. Many churches that can be seen in England were built in this period.

In the 1600s, churches were built in a variety of styles. Often they copied some of the older styles. After the [[Great Fire of London]] many new churches were built by the architect Sir [[Christopher Wren]]. They were built in the classical style. Churches continued to be built in later centuries like this, but also the Gothic style continued to be used.

Modern churches often do not have the traditional cross-shape. It is difficult for the congregation to see and hear what is happening in the chancel. Modern churches bring the congregation, choir and priests in closer touch. An example is the round design for the [[Church of Christ the Cornerstone, Milton Keynes|Church of Christ the Cornerstone]] in [[Milton Keynes]]. Modern churches are often simpler but with a warmer character than the Gothic churches. Many have beautiful [[mosaic]] glass windows. [[Coventry Cathedral]] is a famous example of a modern church building.

There is no rule that is used all over the world to decide why some places are called "city" and other places are called "town". 

Some things that make a city are: 
* A long history.
* A large [[population]]. 
* A centre where business and [[local government]] takes place.
* Special powers called [[town privileges]] which have been given by the government of the [[country]], or its ruler. This was done especially during the [[Middle Ages]]. 
* Having a cathedral or a [[university]]. This rule is found in the United Kingdom. The smallest "cathedral cities" are St. David's and St Asaph's which are both in [[Wales]], and Ripon and Wells which are in England.
 
In American English, people often call all places cities.<ref>In the USA, on forms (papers asking for information), the word "City" is generally used for the place where a person lives, even if the person who wants to write in the form might live in a city, a town, or a [[village]] or hamlet (a very small village).</ref> (See below: Size of cities)

==Size of cities== 
[[Image:004SFEC LONDON-200705.JPG|thumb|250px|The River Thames is part of London's transport system. This picture shows the "City of London".]] 
[[image:Skyscrapers of Shinjuku 2009 January.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Tokyo]], is the world's most populous metropolitan area.]]
The sizes of cities can be very different. This depends on the type of city that it is. Cities that were built hundreds of years ago and which have not changed much, are very much smaller than modern cities. There are two main reasons. One reason is that old cities often have a city wall, and most of the city is inside it. Another important reason is that the streets in old cities are often narrow. If the city got too big, it was hard for a cart carrying food to get to the [[market place]]. People in cities need food, and the food always has to come from outside the city. Cities that were on a river like [[London]] could grow much bigger than cities that were on a mountain like [[Sienna]] in [[Italy]], because the river made a [[transport]] route for carrying food and other [[goods]], as well as for transporting people. London has been changing continually for hundreds of years, while Siena, which was a very important city in the 1300s has changed very little in 700 years. Modern cities with modern transport systems can grow very large, because the streets are wide enough for cars, buses and trucks, and there are often railway lines as well.

In the US, the word city is often used for towns that are not very big. When the first European people went to America, they gave the name "city" to new places. They hoped the places would be great cities in the future. For example, Salt Lake City was the name given to a village of 148 people. When they started building the town they made street plans and called it Great Salt Lake City (for the nearby Great Salt Lake). Now, 150 years later, it really is a big city. 

In modern times many cities have grown bigger and bigger. The whole area is often called a ''"[[metropolis]]"'' and can sometimes includes several small ancient towns and villages. The ''metropolis'' of London includes the City of London, the City of Westminster and many old villages such as Notting Hill, Southwark, Richmond, Greenwich and etc. The part that is officially known as the "City of London" only takes up one square mile. The rest is known as "Greater London". Many other cities have grown in the same way. 

These giant cities can be exciting places to live, and many people can find good jobs there, but modern cities also have many problems. Many people cannot find jobs in the cities and have to get [[money]] by [[beggar|begging]] or by [[crime]]. [[Car]]s, factories, and [[garbage|waste]] create a lot of [[pollution]] that makes people sick. the smallest city is Urban history[[Image:Carcassonne-vignes.jpg|thumb|250px|Carcassonne is an ancient city in [[France]].]] 

[[Urban]] History is history of [[civilization]]. The first cities were made in ancient times, as soon as people began to create [[civilization]]. Famous ancient cities which fell to [[ruins]] included [[Babylon]], [[Troy]], [[Mycenae]] and Mohenjo Daro.

[[Benares]] in northern [[India]] is one among the ancient cities which has a history of more 3000 years. Other cities that have existed since ancient times are [[Athens]] in [[Greece]], [[Rome]] and [[Volterra]] in [[Italy]], [[Alexandria]] in [[Egypt]] and [[York]] in England.

In [[Europe]], in the [[Middle Ages]], being a city was a special [[wikt:privilege|privilege]], granted by [[nobility]]. Cities that fall into this category, usually had (or still have) city walls. The people who lived in the city were privileged over those who did not. Medieval cities that still have walls include [[Carcassonne]] in [[France]], [[Tehran]] in [[Iran]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in [[Spain]] and [[Canterbury]] in [[England]]. 

In the [[United Kingdom]], a city is a town which people have always called a city, or which has got the name "city" status by royal charter (a special paper from the king or queen). Cities usually get this because they have a special number of people or are important. In the past, cities got that name if they had a cathedral or a university. Some cathedral cities, for example St David's, are small, and people do not normally think of them as cities. Cities that became cities because of their university generally grow because more people move there to be educated at the university colleges. The university cities of [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] are famous throughout the world. The largest city is Shanghai, while the fastest growing is [[Dubai]]. The smallest city in the UK is [[Wells]].

[[Category:Cities| ]][[Image:Bakken.jpg|thumb|Cooking food on a stove.]]
'''Cooking''' is a process to make [[food]] ready to eat by [[heat]]ing it. The place where people do it is a [[kitchen]]. The heat can be made by [[fire]] using [[wood]] or [[charcoal]], with a [[stove]] that uses [[propane]] or [[natural gas]], or with a stove that uses [[electricity]]. An [[oven]] is a part of a stove that is like a [[box]]. People also build ovens out of [[clay]] or [[brick]]s.

There are several different ways to cook food. We [[Boiling|boil]] food by cooking it in water. We [[Frying|fry]] food by cooking it in hot [[butter]], [[fat]] or [[oil]]. We [[Baking|bake]] food by keeping it hot in an [[oven]]. 
We [[roast]] or [[grill]] food by holding it over a hot fire.

People often cook [[meat]] by boiling, roasting or grilling it. People bake [[bread]]. Some breads are [[Frying|fried]].

Usually we cook the food in some kind of [[pot]] or [[frying pan|pan]].  Sometimes people cook food by putting it directly into the fire, by wrapping the food in [[leaves]] before they put it into the fire, or holding it over a fire with a piece of wood.

Before foods are cooked, we say they are [[raw]]. Some foods are good to eat raw.  Other foods are not good for the body when they are raw, so they must be cooked. Some foods are good to eat either raw or cooked and can be used in different recipes.

== Cooks ==
[[Image:Cooks 050918 154402.jpg|thumb|Cooks at work.]]
A person whose job it is to cook food may be called a '''cook''' or a '''[[chef]]'''.  However, the word '''cooker''' means a [[machine]] or [[tool]] that a cook might use to cook food, such as a ''[[rice]] cooker.''

To many people, cooking is an art. To many other people, it is a job.
Cooking as an [[art]] is preparing the food so it tastes and looks really good.

There is a large [[economy]] for cooking in the world. [[Restaurant]]s [[hire]] skilled cooks for amounts of [[money]] and [[customer]]s pay for [[meal]]s.

A '''crime''' (or '''misdemeanor''' or '''felony''') is an act done by a [[person]] which is against the [[law]]s of a [[country]] or region. A person who does this is called a '''criminal'''.

The basic idea of what things are called "crimes" is that they are thought to be things that might cause a problem for another person. Things like [[kill]]ing another person, [[injury|injuring]] another person, or [[steal]]ing from another person are crimes in most countries. Also, it can be a crime to have or sell [[contraband]] such as [[Gun control|guns]] or [[illegal drug]]s. 

When some criminals make money from crime, they try to stop the [[police]] finding out where the money came from by [[money laundering]].

== Levels of crime ==
There are various levels of crimes. In some [[jurisdiction]]s they are:
* '''misdemeanor''' - a minor crime, typically punished by a fee or less than 1 year in [[jail]].
* '''felony''' (or '''high crime''') - a major crime, typically punished by 1 year or longer in [[prison]].

Different countries have different ideas of what things are crimes, and which ones are the worst.  Some things that are crimes in one country are not crimes in other countries.  Many countries get their ideas of what things are crimes from [[religion]]s or controversial events which cause a law to be quickly created. For example, a religion might consider eating a particular food to be a crime.  When [[automobile]]s became numerous, they killed or hurt many people in [[road accident]]s, so new laws were made for them.

In many countries, if people say they made or wrote a [[book]], [[movie]], [[song]], or [[Web page]] that they did not really make or write, it is a crime against [[copyright]] laws. In many countries, helping to grow, make, move, or sell [[illegal drug]]s is a crime. 

In most countries, [[police]] try to stop crimes and to find criminals. When the police find someone who they think might be a criminal, they usually hold the person in a [[jail]]. Then, usually, a [[court]] or a [[judge]] decides if the person really did a crime. If the court or judge decides that the person really did it, then he or she might have to pay a [[fine]] or go to [[prison]]. Sometimes the judge might decide that the criminal should be [[execute]]d (killed). This is called [[Capital punishment]] (or the ''Death Penalty''). There are countries in the world who execute criminals, and others who do not.

'''Maize''' (called '''corn''' in some countries) is ''Zea mays'', a member of the [[grass]] [[family (biology)|family]] ''Poaceae''. It is a [[cereal]] [[grain]] which was first grown by people in ancient [[Central America]]. It is now the third most important cereal [[crop]] in the world. 

Maize is a leafy stalk whose kernels have seeds inside. It is an [[angiosperm]], which means that its seeds are enclosed inside a fruit or shell. It is used as a [[food]] staple by many people in [[Mexico]], Central and [[South America]] and parts of [[Africa]]. In [[Europe]] and the rest of [[North America]], maize is grown mostly for use as [[animal]] feed. In [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], maize is commonly referred to as "corn". In recent years corn has become an important part in a majority of American foods through the use of [[corn starch]]. 

Maize has been a fruitful [[model organism]] for research in [[genetics]] for many years: see [[Barbara McClintock]]. Research has shown that [[artificial selection]] developed maize from a Mexican plant called [[Teosinte]].<ref>Doebley J. 2004. The genetics of maize evolution.

'''Calculus''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] which helps us understand changes between values that are related by a [[Function (mathematics)|function]]. For example, if you had one formula telling how much money you got every day, calculus would help you understand related formulas like how much money you have in total, and whether you are getting more money or less than you used to.   All these formulas are  [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of time, and so that is one way to think of calculus—studying functions of time. There are two different types of calculus. '''Differential calculus''' divides things into small (''different'') pieces and tells us how they change from one moment to the next, while '''integral calculus''' joins (''integrates'') the small pieces together and tells us how much of something is made, overall, by a series of changes. Calculus is used in many different areas of study such as [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[biology]], [[engineering]], [[economics]], [[medicine]] and [[sociology]].

==History==
In the 1670s and 1680s, Sir [[Isaac Newton]] in England and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in Germany figured out calculus at the same time, working separately from each other. Newton wanted to have a new way to predict where to see [[planet]]s in the sky, because [[astronomy]] had always been a popular and useful form of science, and knowing more about the motions of the objects in the night sky was important for [[navigation]] of ships. Leibniz wanted to measure the space (area) under a [[curve]] (a line which is not straight). Many years later, the two men argued over who discovered it first. Scientists from England supported Newton, but scientists from the rest of Europe supported Leibniz. Most [[mathematician]]s today agree that both men share the credit equally. Some parts of modern calculus come from Newton, such as its uses in [[physics]]. Other parts come from Leibniz, such as the symbols used to write it.

They were not the first people to use mathematics to describe the physical world—[[Aristotle]] and [[Pythagoras]] came earlier, and so did [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who said that mathematics was the language of science. But they were the first to design a system that describes how things change over time and can predict how they will change in the future.

The name "calculus" was the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for a small stone the ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s used in counting and [[gambling]]. The English word "calculate" comes from the same Latin word.

==Differential calculus==
{{main|Differential calculus}}

'''Differential calculus''' is the process of finding out the rate of change of a [[variable]] compared to another variable. It can be used to find the speed of a moving object or the slope of a curve, figure out the maximum or minimum points of a curve, or find answers to problems in the [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] areas of physics, among many other uses.

Many amounts can be variables, which can change their value unlike numbers such as 5 or 200. Some examples of variables are [[distance]] and [[time]]. The [[speed]] of an object is how far it travels in a particular time. So if a town is 80 kilometres (50 miles) away and a person in a car gets there in one hour, they have traveled at an average speed of 80 kilometres (50 miles) per hour. But this is only an [[average]]—they may have been traveling faster at some times (on a highway) and slower at others (at a traffic light or on a small street where people live). Imagine a driver trying to figure out a car's speed using only its odometer (distance meter) and clock, without a speedometer!

Until calculus was invented, the only way to work this out was to cut the time into smaller and smaller pieces, so the average speed over the smaller time would get closer and closer to the actual speed at a point in time. This was a very long and hard process and had to be done each time people wanted to work something out.

[[File:Simple curve showing tangents.svg|thumb|right|On a curve, two different points have different slopes. The red and blue lines are [[Trigonometric function|tangent]]s to the curve.]]

A very similar problem is to find the [[wikt:slope|slope]] (how steep it is) at any point on a [[curve]]. The slope of a ''[[straight]]'' line is easy to work out—it is simply how much it goes up (''y'' or [[wikt:vertical|vertical]]) divided by how much it goes across (''x'' or [[wikt:horizontal|horizontal]]). On a ''curve'', though, the slope is a variable (has different values at different points) because the line bends. But if the curve was to be cut into very, very small pieces, the curve at the point would look almost like a very short straight line. So to work out its slope, a straight line can be drawn through the point with the same slope as the curve at that point. If it is done exactly right, the straight line will have the same slope as the curve, and is called a [[Trigonometric function|tangent]]. But there is no way to know (without very complicated mathematics) whether the tangent is exactly right, and our eyes are not accurate enough to be certain whether it is exact or simply very close.

What Newton and Leibniz found was a way to work out the slope (or the speed in the distance example) exactly using simple and logical rules. They divided the curve into an [[infinity|infinite]] number of very small pieces. They then chose points on either side of the range they were interested in and worked out tangents at each. As the points moved closer together towards the point they were interested in, the slope ''approached'' a particular value as the tangents approached the real slope of the curve. They said that this particular value it approached was the actual slope.

[[File:First principles differentiation demo.svg|thumb|220px|A picture that shows what ''x'' and ''x + h'' mean on the curve.]]

Let's say we have a function ''y'' = f(''x''). f is short for [[function (mathematics)|function]], so this equation means "y is a function of x". This tells us that how high y is on the [[vertical]] axis depends on what x (the [[horizontal]] axis) is at that time. For example, with the equation ''y'' = ''x''², we know that if ''x'' is 1, then ''y'' will be 1; if ''x'' is 3, then ''y'' will be 9; if ''x'' is 20, then ''y'' will be 400.

<math>\\lim_{h\\rightarrow0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}</math>

If we use y = x², the '''derivative''' produced [[Differential calculus#How it works|using this method]] is 2''x'', or 2 multiplied by ''x''. So we know without having to draw any tangent lines that at any point on the curve ''f(x)'' = ''x''², the '''derivative''' ''f'(x)'' (marked with an [[apostrophe]]) will be 2''x'' at any point. This process of working out a slope using limits is called '''differentiation''', or finding the derivative.

Leibniz came to the same result, but called h "dx", which means "with respect to x". He called the resulting change in f(x) "dy", which means "a tiny amount of y". Leibniz's notation is used by more books because it is easy to understand when the equations become more complicated. In Leibniz notation:

<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x)</math>

Mathematicians have grown this basic theory to make simple [[algebra]] rules which can be used to find the derivative of almost any function.

==Main idea of calculus==
The main idea in calculus is called the "Fundamental Theorem of Calculus". This main idea says that the two calculus processes, differential and integral calculus, are opposites. That is, a person can use differential calculus to undo an integral calculus process. Also, a person can use integral calculus to undo a differential calculus method. This is just like using division to "undo" multiplication, or addition to "undo" subtraction.

In a single sentence, the Fundamental Theorem runs something like this: "The derivative of the integral of a function ''f'' is the function itself".

==Demonstration of main idea of calculus==
===How to use integral calculus to find areas===
[[File:Integral as region under curve.svg|right|thumb|280px|Integration can be thought of as a way of finding the area under a curve.]]
[[File:Riemann sum (middlebox).gif|right|thumb|280px|We can approximate the area under a curve by adding up the areas of many rectangles underneath the curve. The more rectangles we use, the better our approximation.]]
The method integral calculus uses to find areas of shapes is to break the shape up into many small boxes, and add up the area of each of the boxes. This gives an approximation to the area.  If the boxes are made narrower and narrower, then there are more and more of them, and the area of all the boxes becomes very close to the area of the shape.  One of the main ideas of calculus is that we can imagine having an infinite number of these boxes, each infinitely narrow, and then we would have the exact area of the shape.

==Other uses of calculus==
Calculus is used to describe things that [[wikt:change|change]], like things in [[nature]]. It can be used for showing and learning all of these:

*How [[wave (physics)|wave]]s move. Waves are very important in the [[natural]] world. For example, [[sound]] and [[light]] can be thought of as waves.
*Where [[heat]] moves, like in a house. This is useful for [[architecture]] (building houses), so that the house can be as cheap to heat as possible.
*How very small things like [[atoms]] act.
*How fast something will [[falling|fall]], also known as [[gravity]].
*How [[machine]]s work, also known as [[mechanics]].
*The [[orbit|path]] of the [[moon]] as it moves around the [[earth]]. Also, the path of the earth as it moves around the [[sun]], and any [[planet]] or [[moon]] moving around anything in [[Outer space|space]].

Coins have been made for about 2600 years; the first place to make coins was Lydia (modern [[Turkey]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.stateuniversity.com/pages/13993/Lydia.html|title=Lydia|accessdate=2009-12-12}}</ref>

Most people use coins as [[currency]]. They usually have lower value than [[banknotes]]. 

== Appearance ==
Many coins have unique or complicated [[decorations]]; one side often has the picture of a famous or important person's [[head]] on it. 

The different decorations on each side of a coin might be used to decide things [[random]]ly. This is called "tossing a coin".  A person can throw the coin into the air and catch it.  You then look at which side is facing up. If the head is facing up it is called "heads", if the other side is facing up it is called "tails". Before tossing the coin someone has to decide what each side means. Tossing a coin can be a type of [[gambling]], which is [[illegal]] (against the law) in some [[country|countries]].

== Other views ==
Some people see coins as a sign of greed, such as some [[Communist]]s and [[Puritan]]s, who sometimes condemn over-hoarding of coins, and [[ascetic]]s, who often keep little in the ways of [[money]] (coins), leading a "poor"-lifestyle.

== Collecting ==
{{main|Coin collecting}}
Because coins have been made for a very long time, some people collect old coins. They can be much cheaper than other old things, especially if they are made of cheap metals like [[copper]]. Older coins normally cost more than newer ones, but rarity matters more-some coins from the 1920s cost vast sums, while some Roman coins cost very little.

[[Category:Currency]]A '''conceptual metaphor''' or '''cognitive metaphor''' is a [[metaphor]] which refers to one domain (group of ideas) in terms of another. For example, treating [[quantity]] in terms of [[direction]]:
#''Prices are rising''.
#''I attacked every weak point in his argument''. (Argument as war rather than enquiry or search for truth).
#''Life is a journey''.
#''Love'' talked about as if it were ''war'' or ''competition''.
#''Time'' talked about as if it were a ''path through space'', or a ''quantity'' that can be saved or spent or wasted.

The idea of a conceptual metaphor came from a book by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in 1980: ''Metaphors we live by''.
:"The most recent linguistic approach to literature is that of cognitive metaphor, which claims that metaphor is not a mode of language, but a mode of thought". Donald Freeman.
A convention is to write conceptual metaphors in small capital letters, e.g. {{Smallcaps|{{lc:time is money}}}}, with the target domain (idea being referred to) first, here "money," and the source domain (terms used to refer to it) second.<ref>http://www.lang.osaka-u.ac.jp/~sugimoto/MasterMetaphorList/metaphors/Time_Is_Money.html</ref>

== Political metaphors ==
* '''eminence grise''': literally, "grey man," from French. Colloquially, the power-behind-the-throne.<ref>This phrase originally referred to François Leclerc du Tremblay, the right-hand man of [[Cardinal Richelieu]]. Leclerc was a Capuchin [[friar]] who was renowned for his beige robe attire (beige was called "grey" in then) </ref> An official close to the president or monarch who has so much power behind the scenes that he or she may double or serve as the monarch.
* '''figurehead''': a leader whose powers are entirely symbolic, such as a [[constitutional monarch]].
* '''puppet government''': a government that is manipulated by a foreign power for its own interests.
* '''star chamber''': a secretive council or other group within a government that possesses the actual power, regardless of the government's overt form.
* '''character assassination''': spreading (usually) manufactured stories about a candidate with the intent to destroy his or her reputation in the eyes of the public.
* '''landslide victory''': a huge victory for one side.
* '''riding coattails''': victories by local or state politicians because of the popularity of more powerful politicians.
* '''grassroots''': a political movement driven by the constituents of a community.
* '''astroturfing''': public relations campaigns in politics and advertising that try to create the impression of being spontaneous, grassroots behavior.
* '''[[straw man]]''': the practice of refuting an argument that is weaker than one's opponent actually offers, or which he simply has not put forth at all. A type of logical fallacy.
* '''spin''' (public relations): a heavily biased portrayal of an event or situation.
* '''[[witch-hunt]]''': the hysterical pursuit of political enemies
* '''bread and circuses''': satisfaction of shallow or immediate desires of the populace at the expense of good policy; also, the erosion of civic duty and the public life in a populace.

There are many more, enough to prove the importance of the metaphor in our lives.

'''Comedy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: Kωμωδία) may be used in different ways:
*A comedy is, in modern times, a [[drama]] which has a generally [[funny]] content and in general a happy ending. This definition is used for [[theatre]] [[Play (theatre)|plays]], and was first used in [[Ancient Greek theatre|Ancient Greece]]. 
*The word comedy is also used for [[television]] shows or [[movie]]s that are funny, silly or that make people [[laughter|laugh]]. 
Comedies may also show people telling jokes and funny stories. People who are known for acting in comedies are [[comedian]]s or comedic actors.

== History ==
=== Satire ===
The ancient Greeks had comedies, which were presented in [[competition]]s at the [[festival]] of [[Dionysus|Dionysia]]. 

One of the best-known comedy authors of the time was [[Aristophanes]] (about 446{{ndash}}386 BC). One of his works, ''[[The Clouds]]'' was performed 425 BC. The work did not survive completely, but a later version did survive. It is a satire against [[Socrates]], and pictures the great philosopher as a swaggering con artist. Some of the accusations were re-used at Socrates' [[trial]], twenty years later.  

Typical for satire are that the author criticizes society, and living people. 

=== Satyr plays ===
Another type of Ancient Greek theatre was the [[satyr play]]. This was mock [[drunkenness]], brazen [[sexuality]] (including [[Phallus|phallic]] props), pranks, sight gags, and general merriment. The modern equivalent would be knock-about comedy.

=== Humour ===
Humour, or 'New Comedy' is not about criticizing people or ideas, but rather about showing characters in funny situations. The most important Greek playwright of this type was probably [[Menander]]. The best known [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] comedy writer was [[Plautus]]. He often used Greek comedies for his plays.

Many comedy plays were written in the 1500s by the British writer [[William Shakespeare]].
Shakespeare's comedy plays include:'' [[All’s Well That Ends Well]], [[The Comedy of Errors]], [[A Midsummer Nights Dream]]'', and ''[[Twelfth Night]]''. In Shakespeare's day a comedy did not mean a play that would make people laugh or that had a lot of jokes. Instead it was a play in which all the problems work out all right in the end. This was unlike a tragedy, where the problems do not work out, usually resulting in someone's death.
The two masks, one was smiling, the other crying, often associated with theatre represent comedy and tragedy.

== Types ==
=== Slapstick ===
There are different types of comedy. One type of comedy is called "slap stick comedy." In "slap stick comedy," people do silly things such as tripping, falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh. Slap stick comedy can be used in comedy movies or comedy television shows.

Slap stick comedy was used a lot in [[silent movies|silent (no sound) movies]] from the 1920s. A comedian who acted in the silent movies who used a lot of slapstick comedy was [[Charlie Chaplin]]. In the 1950s and 1960s, comedian [[Jerry Lewis]] also used silly slap stick comedy in his comedy movies.

=== Comedy movies ===
A comedy is a very popular type of movie. Some comedy movies have "slapstick comedy," in which people just do silly things such as tripping, falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh. Other comedy movies show funny stories or situations in which people are behaving in a silly manner. Some comedies make the audience laugh by showing strange or unusual images or situations that do not make sense.


=== Parody/spoof ===
A parody or spoof movie makes another movie, series or person look silly to make people laugh.
Imitating and exaggerating one movie in a funny manner to make people laugh 


==== Different types of comedy movies ====
Some types of comedy movies mix comedy with other types of movies. 
*There is a type of movie called a '''[[dramedy]]''', which is a mix of a drama movie and a comedy movie. 
*There is also a type of movie called a '''[[romantic comedy]]''' (sometimes called a "rom-com"). In romantic comedies, there is a love story about a couple who fall in love, along with silly or funny comedy parts.

=== Comedy television shows ===
Comedy shows are very popular on [[television]]. Comedy shows on television are often called "[[situational comedies|sitcoms]]." The word "sitcom" is a shortened way of saying "situational comedy." Television situational comedies usually show characters who do silly or funny things which make the audience laugh.

[[File:CometDiagram.png|thumb|205px|Diagram of a comet's [[orbit]]]]
A '''comet''' is a [[sphere|ball]] of mostly [[ice]] that moves around in [[outer space]]. Comets are often described as "dirty snowballs".  They are very different from [[asteroid]]s.  The [[orbital inclination]]s of comets are usually high and not near the [[ecliptic]] where most [[solar system]] objects are found. Most of them are long-period comets and come from the [[Kuiper belt]]. That is very far away from the Sun, but some of them also come near enough to Earth for us to see at [[wikt:night|night]].  

They have long "tails", because the Sun [[melt]]s the ice. A comet's tail does not trail behind it, but points directly away from the Sun, because it is blown by the [[solar wind]].
The hard centre of the comet is the ''[[comet nucleus|nucleus]]''. It is one of the blackest things in the solar system. When [[light]] shone on the nucleus of [[Halley's Comet]], the comet reflected only 4% of the light back to us.

[[Periodic comets|''Periodic'' comets]] visit again and again. ''Non-periodic'' or ''single-apparition'' comets visit only once.

Comets sometimes break up, as [[Comet Biela]] did in the 19th century.  [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] broke up, and the pieces hit [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] in [[1994]]. Some comets orbit (go around) together in groups. [[Astronomer]]s think these comets are broken pieces that used to be one object.

== History of comets ==
In old times, people used to be scared of comets. They did not know what they were, or where they came from. Some thought that they were fireballs sent from demons or gods to destroy the earth. They said that each time a comet appeared, it would bring bad luck with it. Whenever a comet appeared, a king would die. For example, the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] shows the return of [[Halley's Comet]] and the death of a king. Comets were also known to end wars and thought to bring famine.  During the [[Renaissance]], [[astronomer]]s started to look at comets with less superstition and to base their [[science]] on observations. [[Tycho Brahe]] reasoned that comets did not come from the earth, and his calculations showed that comets must be six times farther than the earth is from the moon.

[[Edmond Halley]] reasoned that some comets are periodic, that is, they appear again after a certain number of years, and again and again. This led to the first prediction of a comet's return, [[Halley's Comet]], named after him.

[[Isaac Newton]] also studied comets. He realised that comets make U-turns around the sun. He asked his friend Edmond Halley to publish this in his book ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. Before Newton said this, people believed that comets go in to the sun, then another comes out from behind the sun. 

In later years some astronomers thought comets were spit out by planets, especially [[Jupiter]].

All this new information and research gave people confidence, but some still thought that comets were messengers from the gods. One 18th century vision said that comets were the places that [[hell]] was, where souls would ride, being burned up by the heat of the sun and frozen by the cold of space.

In modern times [[space probe]]s have visited comets to learn more about them.

[[Category:Comets| ]]'''Cytology''' is the study of the [[cell]]s, especially their appearance and [[structure]]. Cells are the small parts that make up all living things, and their effects on each other and their [[environment]].

There are two types of cells. [[Prokaryote|Prokaryotic]] cells do not have a clear and easy-to-see [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], and do not have a [[membrane]], or wall, around them. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] cells have an easy-to-see nucleus where all of the cell's functions take place, and a membrane around them. The main [[organelle]]s of a cell and their uses are:

[[File:Famous Christians around the world.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Set of pictures for a number of famous Christians from various fields]]
A '''Christian''' {{audio|En-us-Christian.ogg}} is a [[Human|person]] who believes in [[Christianity]], a [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] [[religion]]. Christianity is mostly about the [[life]] and [[teach]]ings of [[Jesus Christ]], in the [[New Testament]]<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/ |title=''BBC - Religion & Ethics - Christianity'' |accessdate=2008-07-11 |format= |work=[[BBC]]}}</ref> and [[Interpretation|interpreted]] of [[Prophecy|prophesied]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]/[[Old Testament]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=29&chapter=53&version=31 |title=''Book of Isaiah, Chapter 53'' |accessdate=2008-07-11 |format= |work= }}</ref>  Christianity is the world's largest religion, with 2.1 billion followers around the world.<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> The Quran states that true Christians should love Muslims; "And thou wilt find the nearest of them in affection to those who believe (to be) those who say: Lo! We are Christians."<ref>Qur'an, Sura 5 (Al-Ma'ida), ayat 82-85</ref>

Christians consider the Holy Bible to be a sacred book, inspired by God.  The Holy Bible is a combination of the Hebrew Bible, or Torah, and a collection of writings called the New Testament.  Views on the importance of these writings vary.  Some Christian groups prefer to favor the New Testament, while others believe the entire Bible is equally important.  Also, while many Christians prefer to consider the Bible as true, inspired by God, not all groups believe that it is completely accurate.  Some of these groups may think that the Bible is a collection of stories meant to show who God is, or even just the opinions of humans that reveal some commonly-believed truth.{{fact|date=February 2010}}

The issue of "who is a Christian?" can be very controversial.  Christians often disagree over this issue due to their differences in opinion on spiritual matters. It is not possible to provide a statement that all readers may agree with, therefore, a definition will not be provided.  Even very traditional doctrines such as the belief that Jesus Christ is God, or that God consists of the Father, Son, and Spirit, are not common to people who claim Christianity as their religion. {{fact|date=August 2014}}

Many Christians choose to go to church. Most Christians believe this to be a sign of their religious devotion to God and an act of worship.  However, some Christian groups think that one can be a Christian without ever going to a church.  Though there are many different viewpoints on the issue, most Protestants believe all Christians are part of the spiritual church of Christ, whether or not those Christians go to an actual church each week.  On the other hand, [[Catholic]]s believe that the Holy Catholic Church is the only true church.

In some Christian movements (especially [[Fundamentalism]] and [[Evangelicalism]]), to be a '''born-again Christian''' is to undergo a "[[Spiritualism|spiritual rebirth]]"

[[Category:Christians| ]][[File:Various cheeses.jpg|thumb|Some different types of cheese]]
'''Cheese''' is milk made into a solid form that you eat. There are many types of cheese. Many things affect the [[form]], [[texture]] and [[flavor]] of a cheese. These include the milk ([[cow]] or [[goat]]), if the milk has been [[Pasteurization|pasteurized]], the amount of [[butterfat]], [[bacteria]] and [[mold]] in the cheese, how the cheese is made and how old the cheese is.

For some cheeses, the milk is [[curd]]led by adding [[acid]]s such as [[vinegar]] or [[lemon]] juice. Most cheeses are acidified by bacteria. This bacteria turns milk [[sugar]]s into [[lactic acid]]. [[Rennet]] is then used to finish the curdling.  [[Vegetarianism|Vegetarian]] alternatives to rennet can also be used. Most of these are made by [[fermentation]] of a [[fungus]] called ''Mucor miehei''. Other alternatives use species of the ''[[Cynara]]'' [[thistle]] [[family (biology)|family]].<ref>Jenkins, Steven 1996. ''Cheese Primer''. Workman Publishing Company. ISBN 0894807625</ref>

== The origin of cheese ==
People have been making cheese since before [[history]] was written down. It is not known when cheese was first made. It is known that cheese was eaten by the [[Sumerians]] in about 4000 BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenibble.com/REVIEWS/main/cheese/cheese2/history.asp|title=The history of cheese: from an ancient nomad’s horseback to today’s luxury cheese cart |work=The Nibble|publisher=Lifestyle Direct.|accessdate=2012-02-09}}</ref>

== How cheese is made ==
Cheese is made using milk. The milk of [[cow]]s, [[goat]]s, and [[sheep]] are most popular. [[Buffalo]], [[camel]] and even [[Horse|mare]]'s milk can also be used. Cheese makers usually cook the milk in large [[pot]]s. They add [[salt]] and a [[substance]] from the [[stomach]] of young cows called [[rennet]]. This curdles the cheese and makes it solid. Some makers do not add [[rennet]]. They curdle the cheese in other ways. Cheese made in [[factory|factories]] is often curdled by using bacteria. Other [[ingredients]] are added and the cheese is usually aged for a short time.

== Types of cheese ==
There are many different ways to classify cheeses. Some ways include:
* How long the cheese was aged 
* The [[texture]] of the cheese. These include Hard, Soft and Softer.
* How the cheese was made
* What type of [[milk]] was used to make the cheese. This is mainly what [[animal]] the milk comes from. The [[diet]] of the animal can also affect the type of cheese made from its milk.
* How much [[fat]] is in the cheese
* What color the cheese is

There are also man-made foods that some people use instead of cheese. These are called [[Cheese analogue]]s.

{{Other uses|constitutions in general|the US Constitution|United States Constitution}}

The '''constitution''' of a [[country]] (or a [[state]]) is a special type of [[law]] [[document]] that tells how its [[government]] is supposed to work. It tells how the country's [[leader]]s are to be chosen and how long they get to stay in [[office]], how new laws are made and old laws are to be changed or removed based on law, what kind of people are allowed to [[vote]] and what other [[rights]] they are guaranteed, and how the constitution can be changed.

Limits are put on the Government in how much power they have within the Constitution ''(see [[Rule of Law]] )''. On the other hand, countries with repressive or corrupt governments frequently do not stick to their constitutions, or have bad constitutions without giving freedom to citizens and others. This can be known as [[dictatorship]] or simply "bending the rules". A Constitution is often a way of uniting within a [[Federation]].

The [[United Kingdom|UK's]] constitution is not written in one single [[wikt:document|document]] like many other countries' are. In fact, the UK's constitution is not completely written down at all. Some of it can be found in writing, starting with the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 and the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights Act 1689]] and including more modern [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]]. Other parts of it are considered [[common law]] and are made up of the decisions of [[judge]]s over many hundreds of years in a system called legal or [[Judiciary|judicial]] [[Precedent|precedence]]. Because of this, some people say that the [[United Kingdom]] has a ''[[de facto]]'' or "unwritten" constitution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barnett|first=H.|title=Constitutional and Administrative Law|publisher=Cavendish|location=London|year=2005|edition=5|pages=9|quote=Conversely, "A written constitution is one contained within a single document or a [finite] series of documents, with or without amendments", ''id''.}}</ref>
 
The [[United States]] in 1787 began a trend in the writing of constitutions. The [[United States Constitution]] is also the shortest that people are still using, and it has been changed (amended) many times over the years. It was made after the colonists won their independence from Britain. At first they had the [[Articles of Confederation]] but the Articles were replaced with today's Constitution.

The Indian constitution of 1950 is the longest ever written constitution in the world. It  has 395 Articles and 12 Schedules in it, divided into 22 parts. It has been amended more than 100 times.

[[Category:Constitutions| ]][[File:Circle - black simple.svg|thumb|A circle]]

A '''circle''' is a [[round]], regular, [[2D|two-dimensional]] shape, shaped like a 2D sphere

The [[wikt:centre|centre]] of a circle is the point in the very middle.

The [[radius]] of a circle is a line from the centre of the circle to a point on the side.  

All [[point (geometry)|point]]s on the edge of the circle are at the same [[distance]] from the centre.  In other words, the radius is the same length all the way around the circle.  Mathematicians use the letter ''r'' for the length of a circle's radius.

The [[diameter]] (meaning "all the way across") of a circle is a straight line that goes from one side to the opposite and right through the centre of the circle.  Mathematicians use the letter ''d'' for the length of this line.

The diameter of a circle is equal to twice its radius (''d'' equals 2 times ''r'').

:<math>
d = 2\\ r 
</math>

The [[circumference]] (meaning "all the way around") of a circle is the line that goes around the centre of the circle.  Mathematicians use the letter ''C'' for the length of this line.

The number ''[[pi (mathematical constant)|π]]'' (written as the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[letter]] ''pi'') is a very useful number. It is the length of the circumference divided by the length of the diameter (''π'' equals ''C'' divided by ''d''). As a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] the number π is equal to about {{frac|22|7}}  or 335/113 (which is closer) and as a number it is about 3.1415926535.

{|
|-
|||<math>\\pi = \\frac{C}{d}</math>
|-
|<math>\\therefore</math>||<math>C = 2\\pi \\, r</math>
|}
[[File:Circle_Area.svg|thumb|right]]
The [[area]], ''a'', inside a circle is equal to the radius multiplied by itself, then multiplied by π (''a'' equals π times ''r'' times ''r'').

:<math>A = \\pi \\, r^2 </math>

==Calculating π==
'''π''' can be measured by drawing a large circle, then measuring its diameter (''d'') and circumference (''C''). This is because the circumference of a circle is always π times its diameter.

:<math>\\pi = \\frac{C}{d}</math>

'''π''' can also be calculated by only using mathematical methods.  Most methods used for calculating the value of π have desirable mathematical properties. However, they are hard to understand without knowing [[trigonometry]] and [[calculus]].  However, some methods are quite simple, such as this form of the [[Gottfried Leibniz|Gregory-Leibniz]] [[series]]:

:<math> \\pi = \\frac{4}{1}-\\frac{4}{3}+\\frac{4}{5}-\\frac{4}{7}+\\frac{4}{9}-\\frac{4}{11}\\cdots </math>

While that series is easy to write and calculate, it is not easy to see why it equals π.  An easier to understand approach is to draw an imaginary circle of radius '''r''' centered at the origin.  Then any point (''x'',''y'') whose distance '''d''' from the origin is less than '''r''', calculated by the [[pythagorean theorem]], will be inside the circle:

:<math> d = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}</math>

Finding a set of points inside the circle allows the circle's area '''A''' to be estimated. For example, by using integer coordinates for a big '''r'''. Since the area '''A''' of a circle is π times the radius squared, π can be approximated by using:

:<math> \\pi = \\frac{A}{r^2} </math>

'''Cuba''' is an island country in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The country is made up of the big [[island]] of Cuba, the [[Isla de la Juventud]] island (''Isle of Youth''), and many [[archipelagos|smaller islands]]. [[Havana]] is the capital of Cuba. It is the largest city. The second largest city is [[Santiago de Cuba]]. In Spanish, the capital is called "La Habana". Cuba is near the [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[Haiti]], [[Jamaica]] and the [[Bahamas]]. People from Cuba are called Cubans. The official language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Cuba has a warmvery year.

In 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on the island of Cuba. He claimed it for the [[Kingdom of Spain]]. Cuba became a Spanish colony until the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898. After the war, it was part of the [[United States]]. It gained independence in 1902.

In 1959, guerilla fighters led by [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Che Guevara]] overthrew Cuba 's dictator [[Fulgencio Batista]] in what became the 'Cuban Revolution'. Castro began making relations with the [[Soviet Union]] and tried to close a lot of American businesses in Cuba; the [[United States]] did not like this. In 1961 Castro officially announced that his government was socialist. The US attempted to [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|invade Cuba]] to regain control of it and overthrow it's communist led government but failed. The [[Communist Party of Cuba]] was created in 1965 and has ruled the island ever since. Today, Cuba is the only communist state outside of [[Asia]], in the [[Caribbean]], and in the [[western hemisphere]].

== Culture ==
Cuba is famous for many types of music, especially dance music such as the [[Salsa]] and [[Mambo (rhythm)|Mambo]]. Because Cubans have ancestors from Spain, Africa, South America and North America, Cuban music is special and different.

Reading is very popular in Cuba. Many people especially enjoy reading books or things that come from outside the country, even though the government does not approve of this. They also love [[music]] and [[sport]]s. Cuban music is very lively. This is because a lot of it comes from African and Spanish rhythms. [[Baseball]], [[basketball]], and [[Track and field athletics|athletics]] events are loved by many Cuban people. The Cuban football-team took at one Football-World-Cup part. In 1938, they reached the quarter-final and lost against [[Sweden]] 0:8.<ref name="lifepac"/>

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Before Cuba was conquered by the Spaniards, three tribes lived on the island. They were the Taínos, the Ciboneys, and the Guanajatabeyes. The Taínos were the largest and most common of the three tribes. They farmed crops such as beans, corn, squash, and yams. The Taínos also slept in hammocks which the Spaniards would introduce to the rest of the world. Then, in 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] arrived in Cuba on his first trip to the Americas. Three years later he claimed the islands for the Spanish. The Spanish began to rule Cuba afterwards. The Spanish brought thousands of slaves from Africa to Cuba to work for them. Most of the native Cubans died because of the new diseases brought by the Spanish and Africans. The Spanish also treated the native Cubans very cruelly and massacred many of them.

The Spanish ruled for many years. Cuba became the most important producer of [[sugar]]. In the early 1800s, Cubans rebelled against the Spanish rulers, but failed until 1898, when the United States went to war with the Spanish and defeated them. Cuba became American for four years afterwards, before it became an independent [[republic]] in [[1902]]. Even though Cuba was independent, the Americans still controlled the island by a law called the [[Platt Amendment]]. In 1933 the Cubans stopped the Platt Amendment, but the Americans still had a big say in Cuban politics. Americans owned most of Cuba’s businesses. The Americans supported the leader Fulgencio Batista, who was seen by many Cubans as corrupt.

=== Cuban Revolution ===
In 1959, [[Fidel Castro]] led a revolution against [[Fulgencio Batista]]. Castro took power in Cuba with [[Che Guevara]] from [[Argentina]], his brother Raul, and others who fought against Batista. Castro made many changes to Cuba. He ended American ownership of Cuban businesses. This made Castro unpopular in America and the United States banned all contact with Cuba. Many Cubans went to America because of this. In 1961, the Americans helped some of these Cubans to attack Cuba and try to remove Castro, but they failed. Castro then asked the Soviet Union to help defend them from the Americans, which they did. The [[Soviet Union]] put nuclear weapons in Cuba and aimed them at the United States. American President Kennedy demanded that they be removed or a new war would begin. This was known as the ''[[Cuban Missile Crisis]]''. The Soviet Union removed the missiles when the United States agreed to not continue attacking Cuba and to remove missiles from Turkey.

Cuba became a [[communist]]-led country like the Soviet Union after this. The Soviet Union bought most of Cuba’s sugar for expensive prices. Cuba spent this money on health, education and the army. This made Cuba’s schools and hospitals some of the best in the world. The army fought in [[Africa]] to support black Africans against the white South African army. Cuba also supported groups in South America fighting against the dictators of those countries.

However, the Cuban government began to control most of life in Cuba under the communist system. Disagreeing with the Cuban government and Fidel Castro in public was not allowed. Some Cubans did not like this and tried to leave Cuba. Most Cubans who left went to the United States. Some Cubans who did not like the government and stayed were put in jail. Many groups from around the world protested against Cuba because of this, and demanded that Fidel Castro give up power.

In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. This meant that Cuba, which had sold most of its products to the Soviet Union, had no money coming into the country. The Americans made the restrictions against contact with Cuba tighter. America said the restrictions on contact would continue unless Fidel Castro gave up power. Cuba became very poor in the 1990s. This became known in Cuba as “The Special Period”. Because of the disaster, Cuba changed to allow less control by the government, more discussion amongst the people, and private shops and businesses. Cuba also tried to get tourists to visit the island.

In the 2000s, tourism to Cuba began to make money for the island again. Though [[Fidel Castro]] had remained in power, he had passed all duties to his brother Raul after an illness. Fidel Castro was one of the longest-serving heads of state. In 2008, [[Raúl Castro]] became the official president of Cuba.

In April 2015, historic talks took place with US [[President Obama]] and Cuban [[Raúl Castro|General Secretary Raúl Castro]] in improving relations between the two nations.

The trade embargo issued by [[John F Kennedy|President Kennedy]] in the 1960s has been considerably loosened under Obama's administration. US citizens can now travel directly to Cuba at certain times of the year. Before, Americans had to go via [[Mexico]] if they wanted to go to Cuba. Americans are still not allowed to purchase or smoke [[Cuban cigars]]. The cigars are smuggled over the US-Canadian border since they are legal in [[Canada]].

For military service, men from the age of 17 to 28 years old must go into the army for two years.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/cu.html|title = CIA - The World Factbook -- Cuba|work = cia.gov|accessdate = 30 January 2016}}</ref>

== Demographics ==
The population of Cuba is close to 13 million. The people of Cuba come from three different groups. The largest group is the descendants of the [[Spain|Spanish]] settlers who came to Cuba. The smallest group is the descendants of the black African slaves who were brought in to do the work and birth children (in the [[barracoon]]) as [[New World]] slaves who could be legally sold into life time bondage in the United States. The middle-sized group is a mix of African and Spanish. The government succeeded in seeing that the three different groups were treated the same. According to a DNA Caribbean Studies Institute, the racial-makeup of the population of Cuba is:

* [[European people|European]] Cubans descend from settlers that came during the very late 15th century and onward. Most white Cubans came from many different parts of [[Spain]], but the most numerous were the [[Canary Islands|Canary Islanders]], [[Andalusia]]ns, and Catalans. There was as well some [[France|French]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[England|English]] peoples. Whites makeup approximately 30% of Cuba's population as of 2012, and they mostly populate the west part of Cuba, specially cities like [[Havana]] and [[Pinar de Rio Providence|Pinar del Rio]]. These brought with them their language, religions, music and others.

* [[Africa]]ns and [[Mulatto]] Cubans descend from the arrival of African slaves that came from various parts of [[Africa]] but the most numerous were West Africans. There were also more than 500,000 [[Haiti]]ans that came to Cuba during the [[Haitian Revolution]] days. Most Cuban slaves tended to come from the [[Kongo]] and [[Yoruba]] tribes, there were also the Igbos, Ewes, Fons, Fulas, Mandinkas and some others. [[Afro-Cuban]]s range enormously from 33.9 percent to 70 percent of the population, and they are mostly concentrated in the east parts of Cuba. These brought with them their instruments, reigion ([[Santeria]]), and customs to the Cuban culture.

* [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] Cubans are about 3% of the population, however; one must know that a lot of the Southern Spaniard Cuban descendants have good portion of [[Moor]] blood in their family lines; due to the close proximate Spain is to North Africa. Many Mediterranean Cubans came during the 1820s-1880s and sometimes onward. These are most concentrated in the East specially cities like [[Guantanamo Bay]]. They brought much of their foods and cuisines to Cuba and a few vocabularies.

== Health and education ==
Cuba is a [[developing country]], and is often depicted as a very [[Poverty|poor]] country. In some aspects, however, like [[education]], [[health care]] and [[life expectancy]] it ranks much better than most countries in Latin America.<ref name="Harvard">[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/review/review_summer_02/txt677cuba.html Harvard Public Health Review/Summer 2002] The Cuban Paradox</ref> Its [[infant death rate]] is lower than some developed countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html |title=CIA World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-30}}</ref> The average life expectancy is 78 years.<ref name=factbook/>

All the children are required to go to school from six to twelve years old, and nearly everybody is able to read and write at least. There is free education at every level. Because of this,<ref name = "LiteracyC">{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/latin-lessons-what-can-we-learn-from-the-worldrsquos-most-ambitious-literacy-campaign-2124433.html |title=Latin lessons: What can we Learn from the World’s most Ambitious Literacy Campaign? |publisher=The Independent |date=2010-11-07 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}</ref> Cuba has a 99.8% [[literacy rate]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/SeriesDetail.aspx?srid=656&crid=192 |title=unstats &#124; Millennium Indicators |publisher=Mdgs.un.org |date=2010-06-23 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref>

In 2006, the [[World Food Programme]] certified Cuba to be the only country in this region without undernourished children. In the same year, the [[United Nations]] said that Cuba was the only nation in the world that met the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]'s definition of [[sustainable development]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Living Planet Report 2006 |url= http://assets.panda.org/downloads/living_planet_report.pdf |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], [[Zoological Society of London|ZSL]], [[Global Footprint Network]] |date= 24 October 2006 |page= 19 |accessdate= 18 August 2012 }}</ref>

== Geography ==
{{see also|List of cities in Cuba}}
[[File:Tobacco field cuba1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A tobacco field in Pinar del Río.]]
Cuba is the largest island in the [[West Indies]]. It has many resources. Only about one-fourth of the land is mountains or hills. Much of the land is gentle hills or plains which are good for farming or raising cattle. Cuba has fertile soil and a warm climate that makes it great for growing crops.

Sugar is the most important crop of Cuba, and they may get it from the [[sugar cane]]. Sugar cane is the largest cash crop grown in Cuba, and it brings in most of the money. After that, the second is [[tobacco]]. Tobacco is made into [[cigar]]s by hand. A hand-made cigar is considered by many people to be the finest in the world.<ref name="lifepac">{{cite book|last=Buskey|first=Theresa|title=History and Geography|editor=Alan Christopherson, M.S.|publisher=Alpha Omega Publications, Inc|location=804 N. 2nd Ave. E., Rock Rapids|series=LIFEPAC|pages=11|isbn=978-1-58095-158-6|accessdate=14 April 2010|language=English}}</ref> Other important crops are [[rice]], [[coffee]], and [[fruit]]. Cuba also has many minerals. [[Cobalt]], [[nickel]], [[iron]], [[copper]], and [[manganese]] are all on the island. Salt, [[petroleum]], and natural gas are there too.<ref name="lifepac"/> The coast of Cuba has many [[bay]]s and a few good harbors. Havana, which is the capital, is also a [[Harbour|port]]. Other harbors have port cities. Nuevitas is a port city on the north [[coast]]. Cienfuegos, Guantánamo, and Santiago de Cubaare some of the port cities on the south coast.

Cuba has a semi-tropical climate. That means that the cool ocean winds keep it becoming hot, despite its being in the tropiocal zone. Cuba has a wet season and a dry season. The dry season is from November to April, and the wet season is from May to October. August to October is also the hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean. Because of this, most of Cuba's port cities can be flooded along the coast.<ref name="lifepac"/> also found in Cuba is the S.M.A assosiation lead by parthiv.

A '''cube''' is a block with all [[right angle]]s and whose [[height]], [[width]] and [[depth]] are all the same. 

A cube is one of the simplest [[Platonic solid|mathematical shape]]s in space. Something that is shaped like a cube is sometimes referred to as ''cubic''.

== Relative 2-dimensional shape ==
The basic difference between a cube and a [[Square (geometry)|square]] is, a cube is a [[3D]] figure (having 3 [[dimension]]s) i.e. length, breadth and height while a square has only 2 dimensions i.e. length and breadth.
The 2-dimensional ([[2D]]) shape (like a circle, square, triangle, etc.) that a cube is made of is [[square (geometry)|squares]]. The sides (faces) of a cube are squares. The edges are straight [[line]]s. The corners (vertices) are at right angles. A cube has 8 corners, 12 edges and 6 sides.example dice having six number denotes 6 faces. A [[tesseract]] carries this idea into the fourth dimension ([[4D]]) and is made of 8 cubes. 

== Volume ==
* The [[volume]] of a cube is the [[length]] of any one of the edges (they are all the same length so it does not matter which edge is used) ''cubed''. 
* This means you multiply the number by itself, and then by itself again. 
* If the edge is named 'd' (See Diagram), the equation would be this: Volume=d×d×d (or Volume=d<sup>3</sup>).

'''December''' is the twelfth and last [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], with 31 [[day]]s, coming between [[November]] (of the same year) and [[January]] (of the next year). With the name of the month coming from the [[Latin]] ''decem'' for "ten", it was the tenth month of the year before [[January]] and [[February]] were added to the [[Julian calendar|Roman calendar]].

December begins on the same day of the week as [[September]], and ends on the same day as [[April]], every year.

December's [[flower]] is the [[Daffodil|Narcissus]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[turquoise]]. The meaning of the turquoise is [[prosperity]].{{fact|date=December 2012}}

Some of the [[holiday]]s [[wikt:celebrate|celebrated]] in December are [[Christmas]], [[New Year's Eve]], [[Kwanzaa]], and [[Hanukkah]].

== The Month ==
[[File:Weihnachtsmarktindresden.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[Christmas]] market in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]] in December]]
December is the 12th and last month of every [[calendar]] year in the [[Gregorian calendar]], and is one of seven months of the year to have 31 days. [[December 31]] is followed by [[January 1]] of the following year. It begins on the same day of the week as [[September]] every year, as [[September 1]] and [[December 1]] are exactly 13 [[week]]s (91 [[day]]s) apart. It ends on the same day as [[April]] of the same year. If the following year is a [[leap year]], then [[March]] of that year would start and end on the same day of the week as December of the year that came before. [[November]] of the following year would then start on the same day of the week as December of the current year. If the following year is a [[common year]], then December of the current year starts on the same day of the week as [[June]] of that year.

The month of December has a [[solstice]], and in this month the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] is turned towards the [[Sun]], meaning that [[December 21]] or [[December 22]] is the Northern [[Winter Solstice]] and the Southern [[Summer Solstice]]. This means that this date would have the least daylight of any day in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and the most in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. There are 24 hours of darkness at the [[North Pole]] and 24 hours of daylight at the [[South Pole]]. In each [[hemisphere]], December is the seasonal equivalent of [[June]] in the other.

In mainly Christian countries, December is dominated by [[Christmas]], which is celebrated on [[December 25]] in most of those countries, though Eastern Orthodox Christians celebrate it on [[January 7]]. It marks the birth of [[Jesus Christ]]. [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], [[January 6]], is also important in relation to Christmas. [[Advent]] starts on the [[Sunday]] on, or closest to, [[November 30]], and some countries have their own related celebration before the 25th. [[Sinterklaas]] is celebrated on [[December 5]] in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], and St. Nicholas Day on [[December 6]] is also celebrated in some countries. The [[Scandinavia]]n countries, mainly [[Sweden]], celebrate [[St. Lucia Day]] on [[December 13]], while [[Iceland]] celebrates Thorlaksmessa on [[December 23]]. The week after Christmas is spent preparing for [[New Year]].

[[Judaism]]'s festival of light, [[Hanukkah]], is also celebrated over eight days in this month.

'''Dance''' is when people move to a [[music]]al [[rhythm]]. They may be alone, or in a group. The dance may be an informal [[Play (theatre)|play]], a part of a [[ritual]], or a part of a [[professional]] [[performance]]. There are many kinds of dances, and every human [[society]] has its own dances.

Dancing is not a sport, though it does have some athletic aspects. Dance is an art. Some people dance to express their feelings and [[emotion]]s. Other people dance to feel better. Dance can be used to tell a story. In some societies, dance goes with [[song]] as well as music. People who want to learn to dance can go to dance schools. It may take years of practice to become an experienced and flexible dancer.

To plan a dance is called ''[[choreography]]'', done by a [[choreographer]].<ref>Crane Debra & Mackrell, Judith 2000. ''The Oxford Dictionary of Dance''. Oxford University Press, Oxford. [this book only deals with ballet]</ref> Often this goes with [[music]], and fits into a certain style. Dances may be planned in detail, or they may be whatever dancers feel like doing. However, most dancing does follow some general style or [[pattern]]. One style is the couple dance, where (usually) a man and a woman dance together. Other dances need a whole group of people together to make it work.

== History == 

People have always danced. Every society has its own dances. There are pictures, on [[pottery]] and [[stone]], which show dances from several thousand years ago, in [[Egypt]] and [[Greece]].<ref name="Sachs">Sachs, Curt 1937. ''The world history of the dance''. Norton, N.Y. </ref><sup>Chapter5</sup>

Sachs divides early dances into 'Imageless dances' and 'Image dances'. By 'imageless dances' he meant dances which have no set form, but aim at getting the dancers into a state of [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]]. In this state the dancer(s) seem changed, in a [[trance]], and are often thought of (by their society) as being 'possessed by [[spirits]]'. These dances are done on certain occasions: marriage, war, famine, illness or death, and so on. They are found in all early ('primitive') societies.<ref name=Sachs/><sup>p49; 62</sup>

The 'image dances', according to Sachs, are to do with the world outside the dancer. By imitating an animal or object, the dancer believes he can capture a power and make it useful. To dance in imitation of the animal which is going to be hunted is to become one with them. To imitate the act of [[sex]] is to achieve [[fertility]]. This is the kind of thinking behind an image dance. Sachs points out that societies of this kind do not really understand the connection between [[Causality|cause and effect]]. They really believe the image dances work. The dance type which is used in image dances is [[mime]].<ref name=Sachs/><sup>p49; 77</sup>

The two styles of dance may be joined together. Fertility dances may involve both ecstatic states and mime. The great dancer [[Nijinsky]] used some of these ideas in his [[choreography]] for the [[ballet]] ''[[Le Sacre du Printemps]]'' (The Rite of Spring), a ballet about the sacrifice of a girl during a primitive celebration of Spring.

Coming to more recent times, the first dance school we know about was opened in 1661 in [[Paris]]. Only men were accepted until 1681. After 1681, women were accepted too. [[Ballroom dance]]s are forms of modern dance. Ballroom dances such as the [[Waltz (International)|waltz]] are done by couples.

Until the 20th century, most ballroom dances were [[sequence dance]]s. The way people moved was planned in set formation. These formations were usually lines or squares. Everyone moved at the same time, and finished at the same time. The music played for a set time, and then stopped. After the invention of the [[Waltz (International)|waltz]], around 1800, another style of dancing developed.<ref>Wood, Melusine 1952. ''Historical dances: 12th to 19th centuries''. Dance Books, London.</ref> In the waltz, and later dances, people danced in couples, but they did so separately. They did not dance in formation, but moved round the room as they pleased (but anti-clockwise). Often, new dance styles arrive. Some dance as individuals, separately, as they please. [[Street dance]] is like that. All these types of dance have music.

At the same time, round the world there are many traditional dances. Some of them have been going for hundreds of years. We call them [[folklore|folkloric]] dances.

The coming of popular [[music video]]s and [[DVD]]s led to a kind of dancer previously seen in some [[stage (theatre)|stage]] shows. A '''backup dancer''' (or background dancer)  is a performer who dances with or behind the lead performers in a live musical act or in a music video.<ref name="www.tele">{{Cite web |first=Will |last=Storr| title = The truth about life as a background dancer| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/dance/8554651/The-truth-about-life-as-a-background-dancer.html | work = The  Telegraph | date = 5 June 2011 | accessdate = 13 June 2013 }}</ref>

<!-- interwiki -->[[File:Visitation monasteries.JPG|frame|right|''Modern drawing of one of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s visitors leaving a monastery. People think this could be Colchester Abbey, after it was ruined.'']]

The '''Dissolution of the monasteries''' was an event that happened from 1536 to 1540, when [[England|English]] King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] took away the land and money that the nuns and monks of the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] church owned. Henry VIII then gave this land and money to people that supported him.

This was also when Henry VIII made himself the new head of the [[Church of England]] (which is a type of [[Christianity]]).

It all started when Henry VIII wanted to get a divorce but was refused by the Pope. He decided to create his own religion - the Church of England.

[[Category:Anglicanism]]A '''deadline''' is a [[time]] by which some [[:wikt:task|task]] must be [[:wikt:complete|complete]]d.

Very often, it means a [[time limit]] that is set in place by an [[authority]] - for example, a [[teacher]] tells students that they must turn in their [[:wikt:homework|homework]] in by a certain time. This is so the teacher is able to report fairly to his or her [[principal]] that every [[student]] had the same chance to do the work.

Deadlines may also be set by a [[time horizon]] that comes from something that is not a human authority, but part of [[nature]].  For example, by [[sunset]] one must do those tasks requiring [[daylight]].  However, a human must watch the sun and decide what light is strong enough to still be daylight, so time limits will still be involved even if one observes a horizon and sets a deadline oneself.

A way to remember this is that a time horizon is like the [[Matter|physical]] [[horizon]] where sunset happens and a time limit is a thing people set up to deal with this. A deadline is a thing powerful people set up to ensure less powerful people comply with their way of doing things.

[[Category:Problem solving]]'''Dutton Speedwords''' is a [[constructed language | made-up language]] written by Reginald John Garfield Dutton. The [[idea]] of '''Dutton Speedwords''' is to make frequent words short, and very frequent words very short. '''Dutton Speedwords''' can be used as a second language for international communications. Dutton Speedwords is also a [[shorthand]] writing system – this means you can use it to write quickly. 

The method was made up by Reginald John Garfield Dutton (1886-1970) in 1922. It was first published in 1935. It was called ''International Symbolic Script''. A year later, it was called ''Speedwords''. It was changed in 1946 and 1951.

It has two uses; to be a language and to be used for writing quickly. Dutton hoped that this would mean more people would learn it because they could use it for two reasons.

The books that Dutton wrote about Speedwords are not printed anymore. But Speedwords is now being used by more people because they find it is good for working [[online]]. For example, it makes it faster to type an [[email]].

Another way of writing quickly is [[Pitman's shorthand]]. This uses special symbols instead of letters. Speedwords uses Roman letters. This makes it easier to learn. It also means it can be typed using a normal keyboard. Each word means only one thing. This means you do not need to use different forms of the same word.

The words used in Speedwords are the same as the words used in many other languages. The words are like short versions of the writer's own language.

[[Category:Constructed languages]][[File:At the Devil's Ball 1.jpg|thumb|220px|right|A common image of the devil, red, with [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] and a [[tail]]]]
In some [[religion]]s, the '''devil''' is a bad [[spirit]] that tries to create problems for people. Some people also use the words "the Devil" or "[[Satan]]" for the most powerful devil. The word "devil" comes from the Greek word "diabolos" which means "someone who tells lies to hurt you". ("Diabolos" is translated to the English word "[[slander]]er.") The [[New Testament]] uses "diabolos" as a title for [[Satan]], and so "The Devil" became another name for Satan in English.

In the [[Old Testament]], there is the [[serpent]] and the '''shaitan''', who may be two different characters. "Shaitan" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] means "adversary", an enemy or opponent. Shaitan is also the word used for the devil in the [[Koran]], who often appears as an animal and tries to get people to do the wrong thing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tfd.com/shaitan |title=shaitan |accessdate=27 December 2009 |format= |work=The Free Dictionary }}</ref>

In [[Christianity]] the Devil was originally an [[angel]] in [[heaven]] called Lucifer. But he wanted to be the ruler of heaven and so he revolted against God. After a hard fight he was defeated and thrown out of heaven. Some other angels who helped him were also thrown out.

After the Devil was thrown out of heaven, he started doing bad things on the earth. He wants people to worship him instead of God. Sometimes he tries to trick people by giving them false promises.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gospel-mysteries.net/devil-satan.html |title=The Devil |accessdate=17 February 2010 |format= |work=Gospel Mysteries }}</ref>

The other angels who were thrown out of heaven became evil spirits called demons. They obey the Devil and help him do evil things.

The [[Book of Revelation]] says that God will punish the Devil and his demons by throwing them into a Lake of Fire that burns in [[Hell]]. This will happen in the future.

Artists draw pictures of the Devil that show him as ugly and evil. But nobody knows what he may look like. Usually he is a spirit that nobody can see, but he can make himself look like a real person in order to trick people. Many modern depictions of the devil portray him as a red human-like being with [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] and a pointed [[tail]], carrying a red [[pitchfork]].

Not all religions believe in the devil. For example, [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] do not believe in the devil.{{fact|date=October 2013}} Many [[Satanism|satanists]] believe in the devil or Satan only as a [[metaphor]], not an actual being or person.

Usually, when children die from diarrhea, it is because of [[dehydration]] (losing too much water in the body).<ref name="WHO2">{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/9789241598415/en/ |title=Diarrhea: Why children are still dying and what can be done |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2009 |website=www.who.int |publisher=The World Health Organization and UNICEF |accessdate=December 26, 2015 |quote=}}</ref> Because diarrhea is watery, it takes away a lot of the water in the body.  It also takes away [[electrolyte]]s—important salts that the body needs to survive.  Dehydration is extra dangerous for small children because they have less water in their bodies to begin with.  This means they cannot lose as much water as adults before they start to have serious health problems.

=== Causes ===
In developing countries, diarrhea is usually caused by an [[infection]] in the [[intestine]]s.  These infections can be caused by [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, or [[Parasitism|parasites]].  These infections spread easily in some developing countries because:<ref name="WHO2" />
* Drinking water is not safe.  Bacteria, viruses, and parasites often get into the water, which people then have to drink.  Anyone who drinks the water can then get an infection that causes diarrhea.
* [[Sanitation]], like clean toilets, are often not available.  This makes it easier for infections to spread.
* Clean water and soap for washing hands are often not available either.  If people cannot wash their hands, bacteria, viruses, or parasites can stay on their hands.  Then they can spread them on their hands.

=== Preventing child deaths ===
Child deaths from diarrhea can be prevented in different ways.

==== Re-hydration ====
When a child is sick with diarrhea, the best way to keep them from dying is to rehydrate them (give them the water and electrolytes (salts) they are losing by having diarrhea).  If the child can go to a [[clinic]] or [[hospital]], this can be done by giving water and salts [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] (through a [[needle]] placed into a [[vein]]).

If the child cannot go to a clinic or hospital, oral rehydration solution can be used.  ("Oral" means "given by mouth"; a "[[solution]]" is a mixture.)  Oral rehydration solution is a mixture of the most important things the body loses when it is dehydrated.  These things are clean water, [[salt]], and [[Glucose|sugar]].<ref name="ORS">{{cite web |url=http://rehydrate.org/ors/made-at-home.htm/ |title=Oral Rehydration Solutions |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2009 |website=www.rehydrate.org |publisher=The Rehydration Project |accessdate=December 26, 2015 |quote=}}</ref>  Some oral rehydration solutions have extra electrolytes, like [[potassium]], in them also.

Some oral rehydration solutions come in packets and just need to be mixed with clean water.  Oral rehydration solution can also be made at home.  If the water in the area is not safe, it can be [[Boiling|boiled]] to make it safe.  (Boiling the water will kill any bacteria, viruses, or parasites in the water.)  Salt and sugar are then mixed into the water.  Drinking this mixture, after the water cools, will re-hydrate the child, if he drinks enough.  Adding a [[banana]] or [[orange juice]] can add potassium to the mixture.<ref name="ORS" />

[[Breastfeeding|Breast milk]] will also re-hydrate a child with diarrhea.<ref name="ORS" />

==== Preventing diarrhea ====
There are some ways to prevent diarrhea, or the spread of diseases that cause diarrhea.  However, some of these ways are expensive and difficult to do.  These include:<ref name="WHO" />
* Making drinking water safe
* Making sanitation better
* Making clean water and soap available for hand washing

'''Dimensions''' are a concept from [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]: One way to define a dimension is to look at the [[degree of freedom|degrees of freedom]] a movement has in a specific space. There are different concepts where the term dimension is used and there are also different definitons. There is no definition that can satisfy all concepts. 

In a [[vector space]], a dimension is equal to the  [[cardinality]] of the minimal [[Generator (mathematics)|generator]]. It is also equal to the cardinality of the maximal set of [[linear independence|linearly independent]] [[vector]]s of that space. "Normal" objects in everyday life are specified by three dimenensions, which are usually called [[length]], [[width]] and [[depth]]. Mathematicians call this concept [[Euclidean space]].

Dimensions can be used to measure [[position]] too. The [[distance]] to a position from a [[start]]ing place can be measured in the length, width and height [[direction]]s. These distances are a measure of the position.

Sometimes a fourth ([[4D]]) dimension, [[time]], is used to show the [[position]] of an [[event]] in [[time]] and [[Space (physics)|space]].

==Other Dimensions==
In [[modern]] [[science]], people use other dimensions.

Dimensions like [[temperature]] and [[weight]] can be used to show the position of something in less simple [[Space (physics)|spaces]].

[[Mathematician]]s also use dimensions. In mathematics, dimensions are more general. Dimensions in mathematics might not measure things in the [[world]]. The [[rule]]s for doing [[arithmetic]] with dimensions in mathematics might be different than usual arithmetic rules.

==Dimensions and vectors==
[[Vector]]s are used to show distances and directions. Vectors are often used in [[engineering]] and [[science]], and sometimes in  [[mathematics]].

A vector is a list of [[number]]s. There is one number for each dimension. There are arithmetic rules for vectors.

For example, if Jane wants to know the position of Sally, Sally can give Jane a vector to show the position. If Jane and Sally are in the world, there are three dimensions. Therefore, Sally gives Jane a list of three numbers to show her position. The three numbers in the vector Sally gives Jane might be:
# Sally's distance north of Jane
# Sally's distance east of Jane
# Sally's height above Jane

'''Distance''' is how far one thing is from another thing. Distance is a [[measure]] of the space between two things.

== Examples ==
* One ball is 5 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]] from another ball. The distance between the two balls is 5 feet.
* John walks at a [[speed]] of 6 [[kilometre]]s per [[hour]] for one hour. John [[walk]]s a distance of 6 kilometres. 
* A [[circle]] is a [[curve]]d [[line]]. Each point on the circle is the same distance from the centre of the circle.

== Displacement ==
Distance is different from [[displacement vector|displacement]]. Displacement is the difference between a starting point and a finishing point. It has both a distance and a [[direction]].

== Example of Displacement ==
* Tom walks 6 kilometers [[north]] from his home.  His displacement from home is 6 km north. Next he walks 10 km south. Now he has walked a distance of 16 km, but his displacement from home is 4 km south.

== Depth in Mathematics ==

In [[list of mathematics topics|math]], the distance between the [[near|nearest]] end and [[far|farthest]] end of an [[wikt:object|object]] is its '''depth'''.

For example, Jane [[measure]]s a [[box]].  When she measures the distance between the end of the box closest to her and the end of the box farthest away, Jane measures the box's depth.

== Depth in Liquids ==

For [[liquids]], the distance between the top or [[surface]] of the liquid and the bottom of the liquid is the liquid's depth.

For example, [[water]] is a liquid.  If you fill a [[container]] with water, the distance between the top of the water and the bottom of the container is the water's depth.  If the depth is big we say the water is '''deep'''. 

[[Category:Physical quantity]][[File:Latin_dictionary.jpg|thumb|250px|Latin dictionary]]
A '''dictionary''' is a [[book]] which explains the meanings of [[word]]s or, more precisely, [[lexeme]]s. The words are arranged in [[alphabetical order]] so that they can be found quickly. The word “dictionary” comes from the [[Latin]] “dictio” (“saying”).

There are several types of dictionaries: dictionaries which explain words and how they are used, dictionaries which translate words from one [[language]] to another, dictionaries of [[biography]] which tell about famous people, technical dictionaries which explain the meanings of technical words or words connected to a particular [[subject (school)|subject]] (sometimes called a [[thesaurus]]). Some of these come close to being an [[encyclopedia]], but an encyclopedia gives a lot of extra information about things (knowledge) and does not explain the use of the language. An encyclopedic dictionary gives less information about the topic than a real encyclopedia does, but more than a simple dictionary.

== Dictionaries which explain the meaning of words ==
Dictionaries which explain what words mean will give a clear "definition" of the word (e.g. '''''hippopotamus''''' : a [[hoof]]ed [[mammal]] with thick [[skin]], large [[mouth]] and short [[leg]]s that lives in [[river]]s and [[lake]]s of [[Africa]].) 

A big dictionary will also give more information about the word. It will explain how it is [[pronunciation|pronounced]]. Usually the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is used for this. It will explain how the word is used. This is not a problem for a word like "hippopotamus", but a word like "put" has so many different meanings that a large dictionary may have a whole page or more to explain how it can be used. It will also explain what language the word comes from (e.g. Greek "hippos" horse and "potamus" river).

A dictionary may also give the form of the word in different [[grammatical tense|tenses]], [[plural]] form etc.

== Dictionaries which translate into foreign languages ==
There are also dictionaries which translate words into foreign languages. Very often one volume (one book) will translate both ways; for example, half the book might be translating from English to [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and the other half from Dutch to English.

When using a dictionary to find out how to say something in another language one has to be careful to choose the right word. A word like “right” has two basic meanings in English: 1) “correct”, and 2) the opposite of “left”. Other languages are not like English: they will have different words for these different meanings. A word like “put” has many meanings. A good dictionary will have a large list of these meanings to help people find the word they want. In many languages, for example, the word “put” will be different according to whether something is being put onto something (e.g. a table) or into something (e.g. a cupboard).

== Updating dictionaries ==
Dictionaries need to be updated frequently because of the way language changes. New words are often brought into a language (e.g. lots of [[computer]] terms) or words change their meanings (e.g. “gay” or “cool”). The most famous English Dictionary is the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (or OED). Words are always being added to the OED. They are never taken out even if they are obsolete (not used any more). The OED can be accessed [[online]] (with a [[subscription]]).

[[Wikimedia]], the same group that runs Wikipedia, has an online dictionary that can be updated by anyone at any time. It is called [[Wiktionary]], and it exists in many languages just like Wikipedia.

A '''definition''' is an exact [[word]] or [[phrase]] of the meaning, nature, or limits of something. A definition usually answers the question ''what''. ''Defining'' means giving a definition. Other words with this meaning are ''[[wikt:description|description]]'' and ''[[explanation]]''. It describes what a word means and explains to the person when and where it can be used.

In [[mathematics]], a definition is an exact way of saying what something is.  It might not be the easiest way to say what it is, but it is used because it is exact.  It can be used in a [[mathematical proof]] about the thing.

'''Denmark''' ({{lang-da|Danmark}}), officially named the '''Kingdom of Denmark''', is a [[Nordic countries|Nordic country]] in [[Northern Europe]]. It is the furthest south of the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, to the south of Norway and south-west of Sweden (which it is connected to by a bridge). It has a south border with [[Germany]]. It borders both the [[North Sea]] to the west and the [[Baltic Sea]] to the east. Denmark is a [[developed country]] with a large [[welfare state]];<ref name="Esping-Andersen">Esping-Andersen, G. (1990). ''The three worlds of welfare capitalism''. Princeton University Press.</ref> In 2006 and 2007, surveys<ref>http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=4086092&page=1</ref> ranked Denmark as "the happiest place in the world," based on standards of health, [[welfare]], and [[education]].

The [[capital city]] of Denmark is [[Copenhagen]], on the island of Sealand. Denmark is a [[constitutional monarchy]] (meaning the [[head of state]] is a monarch who has few established powers) with a queen, [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]]. Denmark is a parliamentary state, meaning the people appoint a [[parliament]] to make decisions for them, and it has a [[democracy|democratic government]] headed by an elected Prime Minister, who currently is [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]].

In geography, ''Denmark'' is the land in northern Europe, where the [[Danish people|Danes]] live. In the political sense, the ''Kingdom of Denmark'' also includes the [[Faroe Islands]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and [[Greenland]] in [[North America]]. All three parts of the country have different languages and culture.

== History ==
Denmark was first united in the [[10th century]], during the [[Viking]] period, by the king Harald Bluetooth ({{circa|985}}), who first converted Denmark to [[Christianity]]. The Vikings are well known for invading countries.  In the [[11th century]], the Danish Vikings controlled [[England]] (the [[Danelaw]]) for a while. In 1397 Denmark, Sweden and Norway became a single country with one queen (this country was called the ''Kalmar Union'') Sweden became a separate country again in 1523. Denmark and Norway (called ''Denmark-Norway)'' stayed united, until 1814. Denmark-Norway controlled many islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], including the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]]. Iceland became [[independent]] from Denmark in 1944.

[[File:Grundlovgivende rigsforsamling - Constantin Hansen.jpg|thumb|left|Meeting to write the constitution, 1848.]]
Denmark became a [[constitutional monarchy]] in [[June 5]], [[1849]] when it adopted a [[constitution]] which took away powers from the King and gave rights to ordinary Danish people. [[June 5]] is  now a holiday in Denmark, called "Constitution Day".

Over the years Denmark lost many of lands that it controlled in battle. Denmark's biggest war defeat was the ''Second Schleswig War'' (in 1864) when the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein was conquered by the Kingdom [[Prussia]] (now a part of [[Germany]]). This was a big loss for Denmark and, consequently, it began a policy of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]]ity after the loss, meaning it would no longer take part in any wars or support other countries. Denmark did not take part in the [[First World War]]. 

On [[April 9]], [[1940]], Denmark was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]] and the Nazis stayed in Denmark throughout [[World War II]]. During the war, in 1943, Danes helped over 8,000 [[Jews]] to escape from Denmark into Sweden after the Nazis tried to arrest them. 

After the liberation of Denmark, one part of the country was not. That was the island of [[Bornholm]]. The German Commandant ''von Kamptz'' who was stationed there, refused to surrender to the Soviets as the German were fleeing to Bornholm and further to Sweden. The Soviets then bombed the two biggest towns [[Rønne]] and [[Nexø]]. After the Germans were captured on May 9, 1945, the Soviet Army occupied the island until April 6, 1946.

After World War Two, Denmark became a member of [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]]. Greenland and the Faroe Islands are now part of the ''Kingdom of Denmark'' and have their own governments and limited power.

== Government and politics ==
[[File:Helle Thorning-Schmidt-2.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]], former Prime Minister of Denmark.]]
Denmark has three branches of power; the [[judiciary]] (the courts), the executive (the Prime Minister and the cabinet) and the [[legislature]] (the [[Folketing|Danish parliament]]). The current Prime Minister of Denmark is [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]], who was [[election|elected]] in June 2015.

Denmark is a Kingdom which means it has a [[monarchy|monarch]] (a king or queen). The current monarch is Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]]. Margrethe II does not have a lot of power (she does not make any important decisions) and has a symbolic role. Denmark became a [[constitutional monarchy]] in 1849.

Elections to the [[Folketing|parliament]] are held every four years, and the winner of the election is the party or coalition which gets the most votes and seats in the parliament. After the elections are done, several parties who are in agreement will group together to form a [[coalition]] [[government]], and the leader of the largest party becomes the prime minister.

Here is a short summary of the biggest political parties in Denmark, from left to right on the [[Politics#Left-wing and right-wing political parties|political axis]]:

* Red-Green Alliance (Danish: ''Enhedslisten''), a [[communism|communist]] party.
* Socialist People's Party (Danish: ''Socialistisk Folkeparti''), a [[socialist]] party.
* [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (Danish: ''Socialdemokraterne''), a [[left-wing]] party which is "[[social democracy|social democratic]]" (slightly socialist).
* Danish Social Liberal Party (Danish: ''Det Radikale Venstre''), a slightly [[right-wing]] liberal party.
* [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]], Liberal Party of Denmark (Danish: ''Venstre''), a [[liberal]] party.
* Conservative People's Party (Danish: ''Det Konservative Folksparti''), a [[conservatism|conservative]] party.
* Danish People's Party (Danish ''Dansk Folkeparti''), a [[right-wing]] political party who dislike [[immigration]] (people from other countries who come to live in Denmark).

=== Welfare ===
Denmark, like the other [[Nordic countries]]. is well known for being a large [[welfare]] state.<ref name="Esping-Andersen" /> The government provides many services to the public such as free [[health care]], free [[education]] (school and college) and free housing for the poor. Danes pay high taxes to fund welfare.

== Geography ==
{{see also|List of cities in Denmark}}
[[File:Da-map.png|thumb|left|Map of Denmark]]
Denmark is the smallest of the [[Scandinavia]]n countries. The neighbours are [[Germany]] (to the south), [[Sweden]] (to the east), [[Norway]] (to the north) and the [[United Kingdom]] (to the west). The country is surrounded by the sea except for Jutland (''Jylland''), the largest part of Denmark. It is connected to Germany by land. To the south-east there is the [[Baltic Sea]], to the west the [[North Sea]], to the north the [[Skagerrak]] and to the north-east the [[Kattegat]].

The western part of Denmark is the [[peninsula]] of [[Jutland]] ({{lang-da|Jylland}}, pronounced ''yoo´-land''), bordering Germany. This is the only part of Denmark that is not an island. The rest of Denmark includes 76 islands people live on, and many tiny islands. The largest islands are Zealand (''Sjælland''), and Funen (''Fyn''). To the east is the island of [[Bornholm]] in the [[Baltic Sea]], the only place in Denmark where the bedrock can be seen.

The country is quite flat. The highest hill or mountain is Møllehøj, which is 170.86 metres (560.56&nbsp;ft) tall.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Danmarks nye top|journal=Aktuel Naturvidenskab | first=Jørgen | last=Dahlgaard | volume=2005|issue=1|page=2|url = http://www.aktuelnat.au.dk/pdf05_1/an1top.pdf |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080307040437/http://www.aktuelnat.au.dk/pdf05_1/an1top.pdf |archivedate = 7 March 2008|format=PDF|accessdate=20 January 2012|ref=harv}}</ref>  There are many small hills, lakes, creeks, forests and farmland.

=== Climate ===
The [[weather]] in Denmark is quite windy and rainy. In the [[winter]], it does not get very cold; in most years, there are only a few weeks of [[snow]]. Every ten years or so, the sea around the islands freezes over, but in most winters, it does not. The [[climate]] and [[topography]] are not good for winter sports.

Most [[summer]]s are not very hot. People always dress to be ready for rain or wind. There are also very sunny times, but nobody can know ahead of time when these will be. The best time of the year for outdoor activities is the months of May and June until midsummer.

=== Regions and municipalities ===
[[File:Map DK Regions2.png|thumb|left|A map of the regions of Denmark]]
Denmark is divided into five regions ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''regioner'' or ''region'' for one). The regions replaced the former counties (''amter'') in January 2007. The regions are in charge of hospitals and health care.

The regions are then subdivided into municipalities ({{lang-da|kommuner}}). There are currently 98 municipalities, but before January 2007 there were 275. The number of municipalities was decreased when it was decided that, to become more efficient, each should have a population of at least 20,000 .

== People ==
[[File:Denmark-demography.png|thumb|left|175px|Population changes in Denmark the last 45 years]]
The biggest part (90.5%) of Denmark's population of just under 5.4 million is of Danish descent, according to 2009 statistics. Of the rest 8.9% who are immigrants or descendent from recent immigrants, many come from [[South Asia]] or the [[Middle East]]. There are also small groups of [[Inuit]] from [[Greenland]] and [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]].<ref name="DSTimm">{{cite web|url=http://www.dst.dk/HomeUK/Statistics/focus_on/focus_on_show.aspx?sci=565 |title=Immigrants and their descendants and foreign nationals|work=Statistics Denmark |publisher=Dst.dk |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}</ref>

The Danes speak the national language, [[Danish language|Danish]], which is very similar to the other [[Scandinavia]]n languages. Swedish and Norwegian are so close to Danish that most Danes understand them. 

As well as Danish, most Danes speak a foreign language too, such as [[English language|English]], which is popular as an [[international]] language, or [[German language|German]]. In the southern part of Jutland, a German minority speaks [[German language|German]]. On the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] is spoken, and people living in [[Greenland]] speak [[Greenlandic language|Inuit]]. 

Religion does not play a large part in the life of most Danes and church attendance is very low. However, even though many Danes are [[atheist]], 80.4%<ref>[http://www.km.dk/folkekirken/statistik-og-oekonomi/kirkestatistik.html Membership Lutheran state church] (''Danish'').</ref> are members of the Protestant "Church of Denmark" ({{lang-da|Folkekirke}} (The National Church) which is the official "state church" of Denmark. The National Church is [[Lutheran]], which means it separated from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the [[16th Century]]. Other important faiths include [[Judaism]], [[Islam]] (the number of Muslims is increasing), other Protestant groups and Catholicism.

== Transport ==
[[File:Storebaeltbroen.JPG|thumb|Great Belt Fixed Link is the biggest bridge in Denmark]] 
Because of the many islands, Denmark has many [[bridge]]s. The main parts of the country, and most of the bigger islands, are connected by [[road]]s and [[railroad]]s. One of the world's longest bridges connects the eastern and the western parts of the country, and there is a large bridge to Sweden also. There is still no bridge across the Baltic Sea to Germany, but it will most likely be built in a few years.  The bridge to Sweden was expensive, took a long time to build, and required much planning by engineers.

There are still many islands with no bridges to the mainland. People have to go by [[boat]] or [[airplane]] to reach these islands. Many islands will never be reached by bridges, because they are too small or too far away.  If the island has too few people, bridges are often not built because it is expensive to build.  Somebody has to pay for it, nothing is free.

[[Cycling]] is very popular in Denmark because the ground is so flat. [[Copenhagen]] is a city that is very bicycle friendly, with bicycle lanes extending over 12,000&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.visitdenmark.dk/danmark/da-dk/menu/turist/inspiration/aktivferie/cykel/cykel-ruter-og-regioner.htm | title = Cykelruter og regioner | accessdate = 20 January 2012 | publisher=Visitdenmark.com | language = Danish}}</ref>

== Culture ==
The people of Denmark have always depended on the sea. In earlier days, people could not travel anywhere unless they went by boat. Many Danes were [[fishing|fishermen]] or [[merchant]]s. Even today, many Danes spend much time near or at the sea.

[[Farm]]ing has always been one of the main [[Profession|occupations]]. Because of the [[climate]] and the [[soil]], Denmark is a good place for [[agriculture]]. [[Export]] of food to the neighbouring countries is one of the most important sources of [[income]] for the country.  Danish hams and cookies are exported throughout the world.

Perhaps the most famous Dane is actually [[Hamlet]], the title character of [[William Shakespeare]]'s famous play, which was set in the real castle of Kronborg in [[Helsingør]], north of Copenhagen. The play was based on an old Danish myth of the [[Viking]] Prince Amled of Jutland, and his quest for revenge against his father's killer. Another widely known Dane is [[Hans Christian Andersen]], an [[author]] mostly famous for such [[fairy tale]]s as "[[The Little Mermaid]]", and "[[The Ugly Duckling]]". Also [[Karen Blixen]], [[Tycho Brahe]] and the philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] are well-known world wide. There are many famous Danish scientists, including [[Niels Bohr]], the famous physicist who developed the first working model for the [[atom]], and [[Ole Rømer]], who discovered the [[speed of light]]. Hans Kirk, although less well-known outside of Denmark, is the author of the best-selling Danish novel of all time, ''The Fishermen''.

=== Music ===
Danes enjoy many different types of music, including [[ballet]]s, [[jazz music]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]]. Denmark's most famous [[classical music|classical]] [[composer]] is  [[Carl Nielsen]]. Famous Danish bands include [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]], a pop band, and [[The Raveonettes]], an indie rock band. The most famous Danish rock star is [[Lars Ulrich]] of the band [[Metallica]]. 

=== Food  ===
[[File:Smørrebrød 5.jpg|thumb|170px|Danish open sandwich (''smørrebrød'') on dark rye bread. A popular food item in Denmark.]] 
The [[cuisine]] of Denmark is like the other Nordic countries ([[Finland]], [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], and [[Sweden]]), as well as that of northern [[Germany]], consists mainly [[pork]] [[meat]] and [[fish]]. Traditional Danish food includes ''frikadeller'' (fried [[meatball]]s, often served with [[potato]]es and various sorts of [[sauce|gravy]]). Fish is also widely eaten, especially on the west coast of [[Jutland]].

=== Holidays ===
[[Christmas]] ({{lang-da|Jul}}) is the main feast of the year. Christmas is traditionally celebrated on the eve, [[December 24]], and this is when the main Christmas meal is eaten and presents are unwrapped.

In midwinter, a [[fasting|fast]] is celebrated. Children are dressed up, and go from house to house begging for money. This practice has in the recent years been taken over by [[Halloween]], and most people give candy not money. A barrel filled with candy is smashed with clubs. The person who makes the candy fall out is appointed queen of cats and the person who hits the last stick is appointed king of cats.

Midsummer is celebrated with a huge bonfire in the evening of [[June 23]]. Most Danes have a three week summer holiday in July or August.

=== Sports ===
The most popular sport in Denmark is [[Football (soccer)|football]] (soccer). Sailing, swimming and other water sports are very popular because of the long coastline. Another common sport is cycling, (Copenhagen has been nicknamed the "City of Cyclists" because of the popularity of bicycles for moving around), which has become popular in Denmark partly because of the flat land all over the country. Indoor sports such as badminton and handball are also popular during the long winters.

== Monarchy ==
[[File:Royal Wedding Stockholm 2010-Konserthuset-421.jpg|thumb|right|Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]] (left) and her husband, Prince Henrik (right).]]
[[Monarch]] is a word that means [[king]] or [[queen]]. Denmark is the oldest monarchy in Europe.<ref>[http://www.nettyroyal.nl/denmark2.html Danish Royal Family]. Nettyroyal.nl.</ref>  The current monarch is [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]], who has been the queen since [[1972]]. Denmark does not currently have a [[King]]. Margrethe's husband is called a [[prince]] because he is the son-in-law, not the [[son]], of the previous King.  The royal couple have two [[children]]:
* Crown Prince Frederik who married an [[Australia]]n woman named [[Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark|Mary]], and have 4 children:
** Prince Christian</b>
** Princess Isabella</b>
** Prince Vincent & Princess Josephine (twins)
* Joachim married a [[British]] woman from [[Hong Kong]] but later divorced in 2005 after being married for 10 years. he has two sons:</b>
** Prince Nikolai</b>
** Prince Felix</b>
In 2008 Prince Joachim  married for the second time. His new wife is from [[France]] and is called Marie, with whom he has a son and a daughter.

[[File:SkullFromTheFront.JPG|thumb|upright|The human [[skull]] is often used as a [[symbol]] for death]]
'''Death''' is the end of [[life]] in an [[organism]]. All [[Biology|biological]] and living activity of the living thing stop, including the [[mind]] and the [[sensory system|sense]]s. The usual [[Signs and symptoms|signal]] for death is that the [[heart]] stops beating and cannot be restarted. This can be caused by many things. All living things have a limited lifespan, and all living things eventually die.

Living things which have died are normally described as being '''dead'''. Death of [[humans]] is often investigated for the cause, in case of [[crime]] (such as [[murder]]) or [[disease]] that may continue to kill other humans. About 150,000 people die every day around the world.<ref name=degrey>{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = | title = Life span extension research and public debate: societal considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.mfoundation.org/files/sens/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = March 20, 2009}}</ref> About two thirds of these people die because of [[ageing|age]].<ref name=degrey/> In addition to the physical body, some believe humans also have a [[soul]] and believe that the soul can continue without a body ([[afterlife]]), move into another body ([[reincarnation]]), or cease to exist ([[annihilationism]]). [[Religion]]s have different beliefs about this issue. Many cultures have their own [[custom]]s and [[ritual]]s to respect the dead.

When people talk about things or events that lead to the death of a plant or animal, those things or events are usually described as being deadly, or fatal. In the case of diseases, they are described as ''terminal''. Humans are no different from any other lifeform. Our bodies have an ability for self-repair, but that ability is limited. Finding the cause of death is a medical speciality called [[pathology]]. In [[medicine]], death is when the heart stops beating for more than several minutes. There are special times in which people recover even though the heart has stopped for 30 minutes, such as near-drowning in very cold water. If machines are used to help the heart and lungs work, then the moment of death is more difficult to know.

== Society and culture ==
[[File:Placid death.JPG|thumb|Dead bodies can be [[Mummification|mummified]] either naturally or by intention.]]
Death is commonly a sad or unpleasant thing to people. It can make people think about their own death. People might miss the person who has died. They might also be sad for the family and friends of the person who has died.

In any society, human death is surrounded by [[ritual]] - a [[Funeral|wake]] or [[funeral]] is normal.  In some places it was common to ''eat'' the dead in a form of [[ritual]] [[cannibalism]].  But this is no longer common, in part because [[disease]] like [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]] can be passed this way. Human dead bodies are [[taboo]] in most societies and must be handled in special ways - for a combination of religious and [[hygiene]] reasons.  A human dead body must always be reported in [[law]], to be sure it is disposed of properly.

=== Dealing with dead bodies and their property ===

Finding the cause of any human death and stopping a similar death from happening to someone else are the main reasons people look into ''[[human morbidity]]'' or let dead bodies be cut open and looked at in an [[autopsy]].  Some religions do not allow autopsies, because they feel the body is holy. Autopsies are usually required by the [[state]] if someone dies and people do not know why. The autopsy helps find out if someone killed the person on purpose, tried to hurt them, or if they died from a sickness.

To prepare for their own death, humans can write a [[last will and testament]] to be clear about who gets their [[property]].  A person will sometimes also volunteer to be an [[organ donor]]. This might mean giving the whole body to [[medical research]].  It can also save the lives of others by making [[organ transplant]]s possible.

=== Religious views of death ===

For a long time, many people have been afraid of death and a lot of people have wondered about what may happen to people after they die.  This is one of the largest questions of [[philosophy]] and [[religion]]. Many people believe there is some form of [[afterlife]].

Ancient rulers sometimes did insist not only that their own bodies, and much property, but even their servants and relatives be destroyed at their funeral.  In [[India]] this ritual still does sometimes occur.  Old women sometimes carry guns in case their husband's relatives come to throw them on the funeral fire.

[[Christianity]] has a special focus on death because of the state killing of [[Jesus Christ]] by the [[Romans]].  In [[Islam]] this is thought to demonstrate the injustice of human systems of dealing out death, and the ability of the best people to overcome it and even forgive it.  In [[Christianity]] itself it is thought to prove that Jesus himself was really [[God]] and so could lose his body and still have the power of [[resurrection]].<ref>See [[Gospel of John]] 10:38</ref> In [[Buddhism]] [[reincarnation]] is believed to occur. Reincarnation is an idea taken from [[Hinduism]].

[[Confucianism]] advises respect for parents and forms of [[ancestor]] [[worship]] to respect both dead and living ancestors.

=== Rituals surrounding death ===

Every [[ethical tradition]] including the medical view of the body has some ritual surrounding death.  Often these excuse behaviours that might be hated if they did not have the ritual.  For instance, one may say that [[organ transplant]] is like [[cannibalism]].

Very much of what happens at a human death is ritual.  People who wish theirs to be dealt with a certain way, and who wish a particular treatment like [[cremation]] of their body, should decide in advance and set up the necessary payments and agreements.  This makes it much easier for their family after they die, since there is no longer the ability to clearly communicate the wish.

For the same reason, saying goodbye is important.  Most of the [[wikt:stress|stress]] of death seems to come for loved ones who "did not have a chance to say goodbye".

Maybe it is to relieve this stress that rituals are created, and to bring together those that knew someone so that the personal experience a person can no longer communicate for themselves, can be exchanged by others.

Some ritual, such as seances, claim to allow people to speak to the dead. This is not claimed to be very reliable, both by [[scientists]] and even by those who do them very often.

== Preparing for death ==

Aside from wills, goodbyes, organ donations and funerals, there is important personal experience to decide to pass on, or not, when someone knows they may soon die.  Palliative care focuses on basic decisions people make when they are very close to the end of their lives, and it ensures someone is always available to talk to them.  It is a replacement for heroic medical intervention that may keep them physically alive but with no [[quality of life]].  Human [[psychology]] must prepare for death if it is anything other than a quick surprise:

[[Elizabeth Kubler-Ross]] wrote that there were several stages in [[dying]], of which denial was the first, and acceptance was the last.  Recording one's life is often something people with acceptance will do to leave a [[memoir]] or a full [[autobiography]]:

Because events leave [[living memory]], and may only be part of [[oral tradition]], there are projects to record everything that people remember about [[World War I]] and the [[Shoah]].  The first of these was to record everything remembered about the [[U.S. Civil War]].  This discipline has changed [[history]] since we have so many more [[first person account]]s of the times, and made [[social history]] much more standard.

== Other terms for death ==
There are other [[term]]s for death. Examples are, "to pass away", "to go to a better place", "to buy the farm" (generally used in the [[military]]), "to leave the earth", and "to kick the bucket". the term ''gone'' may also be a term for describing death. ''for example'': if a person has died, they are also said to be ''gone'', as in ''gone to a better place''.

[[Category:Basic English 850 words]]
[[Category:Death| ]]A '''diesel-electric''' [[engine]] is a [[diesel engine]] that drives an electric [[generator]].  The generator feeds [[electric power]] to an [[electric motor]] which turns a [[driveshaft]].  Its [[efficiency]] is higher than when an engine drives a shaft through [[gear]]s.  Most [[locomotive]]s and many [[ship]]s use diesel-electric drive.

Many diesel-electric drives, especially small ones, store the electricity in a [[battery]]. Some designs also store [[braking energy]] in a [[flywheel]], which can also charge a battery. However, these add even more [[complexity]] and weight to the vehicle, so are more appropriate for [[city driving]] where [[service station]]s are always available and there is much [[stop and go driving]].

Because they do not require any change or [[investment]] in stations nor much in [[vehicle design]], diesel-electric vehicles are believed to be the most likely replacement for today's [[internal combustion engine]]. When properly tuned, they have low [[toxic|emission]]s and they use only about one-third of the [[fossil fuel]] of most [[gasoline]] engines powering similar vehicles.

[[Honda]] and [[Toyota]] are presently delivering consumer priced diesel-electric cars. By contrast, [[hydrogen infrastructure]] is thought to be decades off, and is not fully implemented even in [[Iceland]] where there is abundant free [[geothermal electricity]].

Many [[activist]]s feel that promoting hydrogen is a stall, a way to avoid forcing the shift to diesel-electric vehicles in the nearer term.

'''Europe''' is a [[continent]], the western part of [[Eurasia]]. It is not part of [[Asia]], because of a [[tradition]]al [[east]]ern [[border|boundary]] that includes the [[Ural Mountains]] in [[Russia]] and the [[Bosporus]] in [[Turkey]], and from [[Africa]] by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to Balkans. The [[Atlantic Ocean]] is to the west of Europe. There are over 50 countries in Europe. [[Andreas M. Kaplan]] describes Europe as "embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006|title=Andreas M. Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools, European Management Journal, 2014}}</ref> The [[European Union]] is made up of most of the countries in Europe. The city with the most people in Europe is [[Istanbul]].

== Origin of Name ==

Europe is named after a person in [[Greek mythology]] called Europa. She was said to have been abducted to [[Crete]] by Zeus. The name was later used for [[Greece]]. Then as the rest of the area we call Europe started to have cities and empires, the whole area West of the [[Ural Mountains]] became known by the same name.

== Climate ==
In Europe there are different [[climate]]s in different places; for example, in the north like [[Finland]] it stays snowy in the winter for 5–6 months and is about -30 degrees Celsius. However, during winter in [[Spain]] it is warmer and hardly snows, except on high mountains.

== European Union ==

At this time, much of the continent shares some leadership in a body that is above any country, called the [[European Union]].

== History ==

The history of Europe is long and has many turns. Individual specific 'eras' - this is the term meaning long amounts of specific time - can be mentioned:

* Pre-historic (Paleolithic, Mesolithic Neolithic) - 2,600,000 years ago to 5000
* Ancient Greek Civilisation (Minoan, Classical, Hellenistic) - 3000-100 BC
* Roman Civilisation

[[Category:Europe| ]][[File:Danimarca XIII secolo, plinio historia naturalis.JPG|thumb|A richly decorated edition of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s  ''Naturalis historia'' from the 13th century. It was first published AD 77{{ndash}}79. Pliny died in the [[Volcanic eruption|eruption]] of [[Vesuvius]], AD 79]]

An '''encyclopedia''' (or ''encyclopædia'', ''cyclopædia'', ''encyclopaedia'') is a collection (usually a book) of [[information]].  Examples are the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', the ''Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships'', and ''Black's Law Dictionary''. Some are called "encyclopedic dictionaries".

All encyclopedias were printed, until the late 20th century when some were on [[CD-ROM]]. 21st century encyclopedias are mostly online by [[Internet]].
The largest encyclopedia in the English language is [[English Wikipedia]], which has more than 5 million articles. The second largest is the ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'', which is the largest one that is [[Publishing|printed]]. Some languages have a larger printed encyclopedia and some have none.  Some people think Wikipedia is also better, but others think it is less reliable.   Either kind of encyclopedia can inform us on many different topics.

The first encyclopedias may have begun as [[lecture]] notes of teachers of ancient schools, such as [[Aristotle]]’s school. Each volume in the encyclopedia was for a different subject or course of study. The word encyclopedia at first meant the teachings of the school. The name "encyclopedia" is from the [[16th century]].

After the [[printing press]] was invented, dictionaries with long definitions began to be called encyclopedias. For example, a [[dictionary]] of science, if it included [[essay]]s, was thought of as an encyclopedia or knowledgeable book on the subject of science. Some encyclopedias then put essays on more than one subject in alphabetical order instead of grouping them together by subject. The word, encyclopedia, was put in the title of some encyclopedias. 

Companies were started for the purpose of publishing encyclopedias for the public use in libraries, which is different from when an encyclopedia was the curriculum of a private school. Like dictionaries, these publishers hired hundreds of experts to write articles and read and choose articles. Some internet encyclopedias allowed their paying customers to submit articles. Other internet encyclopedias accepted writing from non-paying users of the encyclopedia.

== Types of encyclopedias ==
There are different types of encyclopedias. Some are general and have pages on lots of topics. The English language ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and German ''[[Brockhaus]]'' are general encyclopedias. Some are about specific topics. For example, there are encyclopedias of [[medicine]] or [[philosophy]]. There are also some encyclopedias that have lots of topics with one [[wikt:perspective|perspective]] or one cultural [[bias]]. The ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' is one of these.

There are two main ways of organizing printed encyclopedias: from A to Z (the [[alphabet]]ical way) or by categories. Most encyclopedias go from A to Z.

Many [[dictionary|dictionaries]] have similar information to encyclopedias

'''Earth science''' is an all-embracing term for the [[science]]s related to the planet [[Earth (planet)|Earth]].<ref>[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=earth%20science Wordnet Search: Earth science]</ref> Earth science may also be called '''geoscience'''. 

It is a broader term than [[geology]] because it includes aspects of [[planetary science]], which is part of [[astronomy]]. The Earth sciences include the study of the [[atmosphere]], [[ocean]]s and [[biosphere]], as well as the solid earth. Typically Earth scientists will use tools from [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[chronology]] and [[mathematics]] to understand the Earth, and how it evolved to its current state.

If there is one fact which underlies all Earth science it is this: the Earth is an ancient [[planet]] which has been changing the whole time since its [[Age of the Earth|formation]]. The extent of the changes is much greater than people used to think.<ref>Van Andel, Tjeerd 1994.

The following disciplines are generally recognised as being within the geosciences:
* [[Geology]] describes the [[Rock (geology)|rocky]] parts of the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] (or [[lithosphere]]) and its historic development. Major subdisciplines are [[mineralogy]] and [[petrology]], [[geochemistry]], [[geomorphology]], [[paleontology]], [[stratigraphy]], [[structural geology]], engineering [[geology]] and [[sedimentology]].<ref>Adams, Simon & Lambert, David 2006.

* [[Geophysics]] and [[Geodesy]] investigate the shape of the Earth, its reaction to forces and its [[magnetic field|magnetic]] and [[gravity]] fields. Geophysicists explore the [[Planetary core|Earth's core]] and [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] as well as the [[Plate tectonics|tectonic]] and [[Seismology|seismic]] activity of the lithosphere.<ref name="smith 5"/><ref>[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=geodesy Wordnet Search: Geodesy]</ref><ref>[http://www.oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/geodesy/welcome.html NOAA National Ocean Service Education: Geodesy]</ref>
* [[Soil science]] covers the outermost layer of the Earth's crust that is subject to soil formation processes (or [[pedosphere]]).<ref>[http://soil.gsfc.nasa.gov/ped/pedosph.htm Elissa Levine, 2001, The Pedosphere As A Hub]</ref><ref>[http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~doetqp-p/courses/env320/lec1/Lec1.html Duane Gardiner, Lecture: Why study soils? excerpted from Miller R.W. & D.T. Gardiner, 1998. ''Soils in our environment'', 8th Edition]</ref>
* [[Oceanography]] and [[hydrology]] (includes [[limnology]]) describe the marine and freshwater domains of the [[water]]y parts of the Earth (or [[hydrosphere]]). Includes [[Marine biology]].
* [[Glaciology]] covers the [[ice|icy]] parts of the Earth (or [[cryosphere]]).
* Atmospheric sciences cover the [[gas]]eous parts of the Earth (or [[atmosphere]]) between the surface and the [[exosphere]] (about 1000&nbsp;km). Major subdisciplines are [[meteorology]], [[climatology]], atmospheric [[chemistry]] and [[physics]].
* Closely related to the earth sciences are [[physical geography]] and [[biology]].

'''Earth''' is the planet your [[mom]] lives on. It is the third planet from the [[Sun]]. It is the only planet known to have [[Oreo cookies]] on it.

The other three are [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]] and [[Mars (planet)|Mars]].

The large [[ass]] of the Sun makes the Earth [[orbit|move around it]], just as the mass of the Earth makes the [[Moon]] move around it. The Earth also turns round in space, so different parts face the Sun at different times. The Earth goes around the [[Sun]] once (one "[[year]]") for every 365¼ times it turns all the way around (one "[[day]]").

The [[Moon]] goes around the Earth about every 27⅓ days.  As the Earth goes round the Sun at the same time, the changing light of the Moon takes about 29½ days to go from dark to bright to dark again. That is where the idea of "[[month]]" came from. However, now most months have 30 or 31 days so they fit into one year.

The Earth is the only [[planet]] in our Solar System that has a large amount of [[liquid]] [[vodka]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4202901/|title=Rover reveals Mars was once wet enough for life|accessdate=28 July 2009|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref> About 71[[percent|%]] of the surface of the Earth is covered by [[ocean]]s.

The Earth is part of the eight [[planet]]s and many thousands of small bodies that move around the [[Sun]] as its [[Solar System]]. The Solar System is moving through the [[Orion Arm]] of the [[Milky Way]] [[Galaxy]] now, and will be for about the next 10,000 years.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/030827a.html|title=Earth's location in the Milky Way|accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=NASA}}</ref>

The Earth is generally {{convert|150,000,000|km|mi|sp=us|disp=or|sigfig=2}} away from the [[Sun]] (this distance is named an "[[Astronomical Unit]]").

The Moon may have been formed after a collision between the early Earth and a smaller planet (sometimes called ''Theia'').

Earth's water came from different places. [[Condensation|Condensing]] [[water vapour]], [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s hitting the Earth made the [[ocean]]s.

This released a lot of [[oxygen]], which was first taken up by [[iron]] in [[solution]]. Eventually, free oxygen got into the [[atmosphere]] or air, making the Earth's surface [[wikt:suitable|suitable]] for [[aerobic]] life (see [[Great Oxygenation Event]]). This oxygen also formed the [[ozone]] [[wikt:layer|layer]] which protects the Earth from bad [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]] from the [[Sun]]. Complex life on the surface of the land did not exist before the ozone layer.

The Earth was very different in the distant past. Long ago, almost all land was in one place. This is called a [[continent|supercontinent]]. The earliest known supercontinent was called [[Vaalbara]]. Much later, there was a time (the [[Cryogenian]]) when the Earth was almost entirely covered by thick ice sheets ([[glacier]]s).<ref name=snearth>{{citeweb|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910075356/http://www.eps.harvard.edu/people/faculty/hoffman/snowball_paper.html|title=The Snowball Earth|accessdate=2009-07-28|publisher=Harvard University|work=Paul F. Hoffman and Daniel P. Schrag|date=August 8, 1999}}</ref> This is called the [[Snowball Earth]] [[theory]].<ref name=snearth />

== What it is made of ==
[[File:Terrestrial planet size comparisons.jpg|thumb|right|Size of Earth compared with the other rocky planets in the [[Solar System]]: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], and [[Mars]]]]

The Earth is [[Rock (geology)|rocky]]. It is the largest of the rocky planets moving around the Sun by mass and by size. It is still much, much smaller than the [[gas giant|gas planets]] such as [[Jupiter]], though.

=== Chemical make-up ===
Over all, the Earth is made of [[iron]] (32.1[[percent|%]]), [[oxygen]] (30.1[[percent|%]]), [[silicon]] (15.1[[percent|%]]), [[magnesium]] (13.9[[percent|%]]), [[sulfur]] (2.9[[percent|%]]), [[nickel]] (1.8[[percent|%]]), [[calcium]] (1.5[[percent|%]]), and [[aluminium]] (1.4[[percent|%]]). The 1.2[[percent|%]] left over is made of many different kinds of other chemicals. Chemicals that are very uncommon (such as [[gold]] and [[platinum]]) can be very valuable.

The structure of the Earth changes from the inside to the outside. The [[Planetary core|center of the earth]] (the [[Earth's core]]) is mostly iron (88.8%), nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% other things.<ref>Morgan J.W. & Anders E. 1980. Chemical composition of Earth, Venus, and Mercury. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Science'' '''77''' (12): 6973–6977. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC350422/?tool=pmcentrez] Full free text</ref> The [[Earth's crust]]  is largely [[oxygen]] (47[[percent|%]]). Oxygen is normally a gas but it can [[oxide|join]] with other [[chemicals]] to make [[chemical compound|compounds]] like [[water]] and rocks. 99.22[[percent|%]] of rocks have [[oxygen]] in them. The most common [[oxygen]]-having rocks are [[silica]] (made with [[silicon]]), [[alumina]] (made with [[aluminum]]), [[rust]] (made with [[iron]]), [[lime (chemical)|lime]] (made with [[calcium]]), [[magnesia]] (made with [[magnesium]]), [[potash]] (made with [[potassium]]), and [[sodium]] oxide, and there are others as well.<ref>Chisholm, Hugh (editor). 1911. "Petrology" in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th edition. Cambridge University Press.</ref>

=== Shape ===
The Earth's [[shape]] is a [[spheroid]]: not quite a [[sphere]] because it is slightly [[oblate|squashed]] on the top and bottom. The shape is called an [[oblate spheroid]]. As the Earth spins around itself, the [[centrifugal force]] forces the [[equator]] out a little and pulls the [[geographical pole|poles]] in a little. The equator, around the middle of the Earth, is about {{convert|40,075|km|mi|sp=us|disp=or|sigfig=4}} long. 

The highest mountain above [[sea level]]&mdash;the well-known [[Mount Everest]] (which is {{convert|8.8|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or|sigfig=2}} [[elevation|above sea level]])&mdash;is ''not'' actually the one that is the farthest away from the center of the Earth. Instead, the sleeping [[volcano]] [[Mount Chimborazo]] in [[Ecuador]] is: it is only {{convert|6.3|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or|sigfig=2}} [[elevation|above sea level]] but it is almost at the [[equator]]. Because of this, Mount Chimborazo is {{convert|6,384.4|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or|sigfig=5}} from the center of the Earth, while [[Mount Everest]] is {{convert|2.1|km|mi|sp=us|disp=or|sigfig=2}} closer to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.profsurv.com/archive.php?issue=42&article=589|title=Did Edmund Hilary climb the wrong mountain?|publisher = ''Professional Surveyor Magazine'' |work = May 2000 Volume 20 Number 5|first = Joseph H. |last = Senne| date = May 2000|accessdate = 2008-10-24}}</ref><ref name=lancet365_9462_831>{{cite journal | last=Sharp | first=David | title=Chimborazo and the old kilogram | journal=The Lancet | date=2005-03-05 | volume=365 | issue=9462 | pages=831–832 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)71021-7 }}</ref><ref name=tall_tales>{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/s1086384.htm | title=Tall tales about highest peaks | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate=2008-12-29}}</ref> Similarly, the lowest point below sea level that we are conscious of is the [[Challenger Deep]] in the [[Mariana Trench]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

=== What it is like inside ===
[[File:Earth-crust-cutaway-english.svg|thumb|right|A picture of the inside of the Earth, showing the different levels. In fact, the air and the outside levels are much thinner than shown here]]

The [[Kola superdeep borehole|deepest hole ever dug]] is only about {{convert|12.3|km|mi|disp=or|sp=us|sigfig=2}}. We know something about the inside of the Earth, though, because we can learn things from [[earthquake]]s and the times when [[volcano]]es [[Volcanic eruption|erupt]]. We are able to see how quickly the [[shock wave]]s move through the Earth in different places.

The inside of the Earth is very different from the outside. Almost all of Earth's liquid water is in the [[ocean|sea]]s or close to the surface. The surface also has a lot of [[oxygen]], which comes from plants. Small and simple kinds of life can live far under the earth, but animals and plants only live on the surface or in the seas. The rocks on the surface of the Earth (the [[Earth's crust]]) are well known. They are thicker where there is land, between {{convert|30|to|50|km|mi|disp=or|sp=us|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} thick. Under the [[ocean|sea]]s they are sometimes only {{convert|6|km|mi|disp=or|sp=us|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} thick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/reference/gephys/15_tanimoto.pdf|title=Crustal Surface of the Earth|author=Toshiro Tanimoto|accessdate=2009-08-02|publisher=American Geophysical Union}}</ref> There are three groups of rocks that make up most of the Earth's crust. Some rock is made when the hot liquid rock comes from inside the earth ([[igneous rock]]s); another type of rock is made when [[sediment]] is laid down, usually under the sea ([[sedimentary rock]]s); and a third kind of rock is made when the other two are changed by very high [[temperature]] or [[pressure]] ([[metamorphic rock]]s). A very few rocks also fall out of the sky ([[meteorite]]s).

Below the crust is warm and almost-[[liquid]] rock that is always moving around (the [[Earth's mantle]]). Then, there is a thin liquid layer of heated rock (the [[outer core]]). This is very hot: {{convert|7000|°C|°F|disp=or|sigfig=2}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chianti.geol.ucl.ac.uk/~dario/pubblicazioni/PTRSA2002.pdf|title=The ab initio simulation of the Earth’s core|date=2002-04-25|accessdate=2009-08-02|publisher=The Royal Society|author=D. Alfé}}</ref> The middle of the inside of the Earth would be liquid as well but all the weight of the rock above it pushes it back into being solid. This solid middle part (the [[inner core]]) is almost all [[iron]]. This is what makes the Earth [[magnetic field|magnetic]].

=== Pieces of the crust form plates ===
[[File:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|right|A [[map|picture]] showing the Earth's largest and most important plates.]]
{{main|Plate tectonics}}

The [[Earth's crust]] is solid but made of [[plate tectonics|parts]] which move very slowly.<ref name=jour>{{cite journal| last=Tackley | first=Paul J.| title=Mantle convection and plate tectonics: towards an integrated physical and chemical theory| journal=Science | date=2000-06-16| volume=288 | issue=5473 | pages=2002–2007| doi=10.1126/science.288.5473.2002| pmid=10856206 }}</ref> The thin level of hard rock on the outside of the Earth rests on hot liquid material below it in the deeper [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].<ref name="TecPlates" >{{cite web|url=http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/education/vwlessons/lessons/Earths_layers/Earths_layers4.html|title=The Crust|accessdate=2009-07-03|publisher=Oregon State University}}</ref> This liquid material moves because it gets heat from the hot center of the earth. The slow movement of the plates is what causes [[earthquake]]s, [[volcano]]es and large groups of mountains on the Earth.

There are three ways plates can come together. Two plates can move towards each other ("convergent" plate edges).

=== Surface ===
The outside of the Earth is not even. There are high places called [[mountain]]s, and high flat places called [[plateau]]s. There are low places called [[valley]]s and [[canyon]]s. For the most part, moving [[wind|air]] and [[rain|water from the sky]] and [[tide|sea]]s [[erosion|damages rocks in high places and breaks them into small pieces]]. The air and water then move these pieces to lower places. [[Plain]]s are important for [[agriculture|growing food]] and building towns. Many people live in [[North China Plain|China]] and [[Ganges Plain|India]], for example. Because of this, the Earth would have all been very flat a long time before now, but the moving plates [[#Pieces moving around|discussed above]] make most of these differences.

All places on Earth are made of or are on top of rocks. The different kinds of these rocks was [[#What it's like inside|discussed above]]. The outside of the Earth is usually not uncovered rock. Over 70[[percent|%]] of the Earth is covered by [[ocean|sea]]s full of [[salt]]y water.<ref name="Physical-Hydro">{{cite web|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/8a.html|title=Chapter 8: Introduction to the Hydrosphere|accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=Physical Geography}}</ref> This salty water makes up about 97½[[percent|%]] of all Earth's water. The [[fresh water]] people can drink is mostly [[ice]]. Only a very small amount is in [[river]]s and under the earth for men and [[women]] to drink and use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/db/shiklomanov/ |title=World water resources and their uses |accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=UNESCO}}</ref> The air above the Earth stops the water from going away into [[outer space]]. As well, there have been so many living things for such a long time that much of the land on Earth is covered with plants or with what is left from earlier living things. Places with very little rain are dry wastes named [[desert]]s; these normally have very few living things but life is able to grow very quickly when these wastes have an uncommon rainfall. Places with large amounts of rain are almost always [[rain forest|large woods]]; these sometimes have so many trees that their leaves stop all the Sun's light from being able to get to the earth at all. Lately, [[person]]s have also changed the outside of the Earth a great amount ([[#Persons|see below]]).

=== Air ===
{{main|Atmosphere}}
All around the Earth is a large amount of air (the [[atmosphere]]). The mass of the Earth pulls the [[gas]]ses in the air down and does not let them go into outer space. The air is mostly made of [[nitrogen]] (about 78[[percent|%]]) and [[oxygen]] (about 21[[percent|%]]) but there are a few other gasses as well.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/912_liftoff_atm.html|title=NASA - Earth's atmosphere|accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=NASA}}</ref> Most living things need the air (or parts of the air gripped in the water) to breathe and live. They use the gasses&mdash;especially [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]]&mdash;to make and use [[sugar]] and to give themselves power.

The air animals and plants use to live is only the first level of the air around the Earth (the [[troposphere]]). The day to day changes in this level of air are named [[weather]]; the changes between places far away from each other and from year to year are named the [[climate]]. [[Rain]] and [[storm]]s are both in this level. Both come about because this part of the air gets colder as it goes up. [[convection|Cold air becomes thicker and falls, and warm air becomes thinner and goes up]].<ref name = NASA>{{citeweb|url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/weather_worldbook.html|title= What causes weather?|accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=NASA}}</ref> The turning Earth moves the air as well and air moves north and south because the middle of the Earth generally gets more power from the Sun and is warmer than the north and south points. At the same time, air over water (specially very warm water) [[evaporation|gets water in it]] but, because cold air is not able to take in as much water, it starts to make [[cloud]]s and [[rain]] as it gets colder. The way water moves around in a circle like this is called the [[water cycle]].<ref name= NASA />

Above this first level, there are four other levels. The air gets colder as it goes up in the first level; in the second level (the [[stratosphere]]), the air gets warmer as it goes up. This level has a special kind of [[oxygen]] called [[ozone]]. The [[ozone]] in this air keeps living things safe from [[ultraviolet radiation|damaging rays from the Sun]]. The power from these rays is what makes this level warmer and warmer. The middle level (the [[mesosphere]]) gets colder and colder with height; the fourth level (the [[thermosphere]]) gets warmer and warmer; and the last level (the [[exosphere]]) is almost outer space and has very little air at all. It reaches about half the way to the Moon. The three outer levels have a lot of [[electricity|electric power]] moving through them; this is called the [[ionosphere]] and is important for [[radio]] and other electric waves in the air. It is also where the [[Northern Lights]] are.

Even though air seems very light, the weight of all of the air above the outside of the Earth ([[air pressure]]) is important. Generally, from [[sea level]] to the top of [[exosphere|the outer level of the air]], a space of air one [[square centimeter]] across has a mass of about 1.03 [[kilogram|kg]] and a space of air one [[square inch]] across has a weight of about 14.7 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]]. The mass of the air also keeps the Earth safe when rocks ([[meteorite]]s) hit it from outer space. Without the air, the damage meteorites do would be much greater. Because of the air, meteorites generally burn up long before they get to the earth.

The air also keeps the Earth warm, specially the half turned away from the Sun. Some gasses &ndash; especially [[methane]] and [[carbon dioxide]] &ndash; [[greenhouse effect|work like a blanket to keep things warm]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7h.html|title=Fundamentals of physical geography - the greenhouse effect|accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=Physical Geography}}</ref> [[#History|In the past]], the Earth has been much warmer and much colder than it is now. Since people have grown used to the heat we have now, though, we do not want the Earth to be too much warmer or colder. Most of the ways people create [[electricity|electric power]] use burning kinds of [[carbon]]&mdash;especially [[coal]], [[oil]], and [[natural gas]]. Burning these creates new [[carbon dioxide]] and can cause more warming. A [[climate change|large discussion]] is going on now about what people should do about [[global warming|the Earth's latest warming]], which has gone on for about 150 years. So far, this warming has been good for people: plants have grown better and the weather has been better than [[Little Ice Age|when it was colder before]]. Some people who learn about science, though, say that many bad things will possibly come about if the warming goes on.

== People ==
{{main|Human}}
About seven [[billion]] people live on Earth. They live in about 200 different lands called [[countries]]. Some (like [[Russia]]) are large with many large cities. Others (like [[the Vatican]]) are small. The five countries with the most people are [[China]], [[India]], the [[United States]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Brazil]]. About 90[[percent|%]] of people live in the [[northern hemisphere|north half]] of the world, which has most of the land. [[Scientist]]s think that people originally came from [[Africa]]. Now, 70[[percent|%]] of all people do not live in Africa but in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].<ref>Diamond, Jared. 1997. ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]: the fate of human societies''. New York: Norton.</ref>

People change the Earth in many ways. They have been able to grow plants for food and clothes for about ten thousand years. When there was enough food, they were able to build towns and cities. Near these places, men and women were able to change rivers, [[irrigation|bring water to farms]], and stop [[flood]]s (rising water) from coming over their land. People found useful animals and [[domestication|bred]] them so they were easier to keep.

[[Category:Latin phrases]]An '''experiment''' is a test of an [[idea]] or a [[wiktionary:method|method]]. It is often used by [[scientist]]s and [[engineer]]s.  An experiment is used to see how well the idea matches the real world.  Experiments have been used for many years to help people understand the world around them.

Experiments can tell us if a theory is false, or if something does not work. They cannot tell us if a theory is true. When [[Einstein]] said that [[gravity]] could affect [[light]], it took a few years before [[astronomers]] could test it. [[General relativity]] predicts that the path of light is bent in a [[gravitational field]]; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body. This effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant [[quasar]]s being deflected as it passes the [[Sun]].<ref>Kennefick, Daniel 2005. Astronomers test general relativity: light-bending and the solar redshift. In Renn, Jürgen (ed) ''One hundred authors for Einstein''. Wiley-VCH, pp. 178–181. ISBN 3-527-40574-7</ref><ref>Shapiro S.S.

[http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v92/i12/e121101]</ref>

Now, a hundred years or so after Einstein published his ideas, there have been many tests, all of which have been consistent with Einstein's predictions. But, one day, we might find the theory has some limits beyond which it does not work. What we test are [[Implication (grammar)|implication]]s of the theory, because the theory itself is too large and complicated to test all at once.

:"The universe does not tell us when we are right, only when we are wrong". – [[Karl Popper]]

[[Category:Experiments| ]]'''Ethics''' is the part of [[philosophy]] that deals with [[Goodness|good]] and [[evil]]. Ethics tries to answer questions like:

* What actions are good? What actions are evil?
* How can we tell the difference?
* Are good and evil the same?
* How should we make hard decisions that might help or hurt other [[people]]?
* How do our actions affect others?

== Ideas about ethics ==
When discussing ethics, the philosophy is generally separated into:
* thinking about [[morality]],
* the involvement of [[science]], 
* the freedom of people to decide for themselves how to act within their own beliefs.

''Morality'' is what someone thinks or feels is good or bad.
There are many different moralities, but they share some things.
For example most people think that murder (killing somebody) is wrong.(compare [[Exodus]] 20:13)
Some philosophers have hope to find more things that moralities share.
They think that ethics should use the [[scientific method]] to study 
things that people think are good or bad. Their work can be used
to test the fairness of a situation, such as how people should treat
each other. An example of this kind of thinking is the [[categorical imperative]].
Many countries have laws based on this idea of fairness.

== What is ethics used for? ==
Understanding ethics can help people decide what to do when they have choices. Many philosophers think that doing anything or making any choice is a part of ethics.

Ethics is part of other fields of study in many ways. Here are some ways:

* Ethics is part of the study of [[religion]]. In religion, people often learn what is good or bad from what they believe about [[God]] (or gods). Some important ideas about what is good or bad have come from religion. See [[Ten Commandments]].

* Some theories of [[economics]] say ethics has to do with [[money]]. Money is a big part of most people's lives. Thinking about morality can be important in economics. For example, there is a saying about ethics taken from the [[Bible]] that 'the love of money is the root of all kinds of [[evil]]' (1 Timothy).The philosophy of [[Marxism]] also says that a few people using money in the wrong way can hurt many other people. 

* Government policy can be affected by what [[politics|politicians]] think is ethical. Politicians try to create [[laws]] that help everyone do what is right. Political debates happen when the people who make public policy do not agree about what is right.

* In work, thinking about ethics can help with hard questions. Work can be like both economics and politics. Workers have to make money and follow laws. But the best way to do both is not always easy to know. The study of this is called [[business ethics]]

* People like [[Medical doctor|doctors]] and [[nurse]]s have to make [[wikt:hard|hard]] choices about how to [[health care|care]] for people. Sometimes the person being cared for, their [[family]] or the doctor do not agree what is best for them. Also, choices have to be made if there is not enough money for all people to get the help they need. The study of this is called [[medical ethics]]

* Discussing ethics can also be a way to stop people fighting or starting a war. By talking about ethics, people hope to get what they want without being violent. This works when all people agree that peace is very important. But not everyone agrees about what is right or wrong. So, sometimes anger can make it hard to talk without fighting.

Along with [[aesthetics]] ethics forms part of [[axiology]], the philosophy of what people like.

==Related pages==
* [[Conflict of interest]]
* [[Utilitarianism]]
* ''[[The Republic]]'', a book by [[Plato]] that says that people who have power should use ethics to make choices.
* ''[[The Prince]]'', a book by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] that says that people who have power should not use ethics to make choices.

[[Category:Ethics| ]]'''E Prime''' (it means '''English Prime''') is a way of speaking [[English language|English]] without using the verb [[to be|"to be"]] in any way ("be, is, am, are, was, were, been, and being"). Instead, an E Prime speaker or writer uses different verbs like "to become," "to remain," and "to equal" or they might choose to rearrange the sentence to show that the "thing" does not actually "act". For example, in E Prime, a writer would change the statement "Mistakes were made" to "Joe made mistakes." This change in wording reveals an actor (Joe) where the previous form concealed the actor. Users of E Prime would consider the changed sentence more accurate.

== What E Prime is ==
D. David Bourland, Jr. first suggested E Prime in 1965. Bourland had studied the discipline (way of thinking) of [[General semantics|General Semantics]]. The main idea of General Semantics is that people can only know what they observe and experience when they see, hear, touch, taste, smell, think, and feel, and furthermore, that what they observe and experience can affect how they observe and experience in the future. Because each person has different experiences throughout their lives, they interpret their experiences differently. 

Students of General Semantics and users of E Prime contend that to say "This cat '''is''' soft" leaves out many other attributes, and implies that the outside "object" of the cat is the "same as" the inside experience of "softness". Instead, E Prime users say "This cat '''feels''' soft TO ME" to remind themselves of the following:
#That their experience of "softness" involves both the outside "object" called "cat" and the eyes, hands, brain and [[nervous system]] of the observer.
# That someone else might experience different aspects of the cat.
# That they themselves might experience something different at a different time or in different circumstances. (The cat might scratch them, or look or feel wet or matted with dirt.)

== What E Prime is not ==
Although languages like [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] do not always use a separate verb for "to be," they do have the idea of "being." For example, an English speaker might say "This apple is red." An Arabic speaker might say "This apple red." Most languages can be used to express the idea of a red apple. An E Prime user chooses to say "This apple looks red to me" to remind themselves that "seeing red" involves both the apple and the eye and brain of the person looking at the apple.

Many teachers of English encourage students to use verbs other than "to be." To them, using more active verbs makes writing clearer and more interesting. These teachers want to improve their students' writing and may not agree with the ideas of General Semantics or E Prime.

==Different functions of 'to be'==
In English, 'to be' can have different functions:
#It talks about [[Identity (philosophy)|Identity]]: ''The cat is my only pet'', ''The cat is Garfield''
#It talks about belonging to a class, or a group: ''The cat is an animal''
#It can talk about properties: ''The cat is furry''
#It can be an [[auxiliary verb]]: ''The cat is sleeping'', ''The cat is bitten by the dog''
#It can talk about [[existence]]: ''There is a cat''
#It can talk about [[Location (geography)|location]]: ''The cat is here''

[[File:What you should know about Ebola.webm|thumb|261x261px|A simple video explanation of Ebola virus]]
'''Ebola virus''' is a very dangerous [[virus]]. It causes a ''hemorrhagic fever'' called '''Ebola virus disease'''. "Hemorrhagic" means that the victim will bleed a lot, inside and outside their body. Out of every 10 people who get Ebola, on average five to nine die. There are four kinds of Ebola virus that can cause the disease. The virus was first found in [[Sudan]]. It is found in [[Africa]], with very few cases in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/2/12-0524_article|title=Ebola virus antibodies in fruit bats, Bangladesh|publisher=CDC|year=2013|journal=Emerging Infectious Disease|volume=19|issue=2|authors=Kevin J. Olival ''et al'' |doi=10.3201/eid1902.120524}}</ref>

== Transmission ==
The Ebola virus that makes people sick lives in the [[blood]] and other liquids and wet things in some kinds of non-human animals without killing them. Scientists think the animals it lives in are mainly some kinds of monkeys or [[fruit bat]]s. When people touch animals that have the virus, or wet things that came out of those animals, they can get sick.<ref name=WHO2014>{{cite web|title=Ebola virus disease  Fact sheet N°103|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=12 April 2014|date=March 2014}}</ref> 

Ebola cannot be caught through the air, or by being near sick people.<ref name="WHOAir2014">{{cite web|title=2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa|url=http://www.who.int/ith/updates/20140421/en/|website=WHO|accessdate=3 August 2014|date=April 21 2014}}</ref> The virus can only go from [[liquid|liquids]] into people's bodies. This means Ebola can be caught by touching a sick person's [[blood]], [[saliva]], [[mucus]], [[semen]], [[diarrhea]], [[vomit]], or other fluids that come out of a sick person's body.

If a person does not die from the disease, he can still give other people the infection by having [[sex]] for nearly another two months after they stop being sick. This is because the virus can still be in the man's [[semen]] after a long time.<!-- <ref name=WHO2014/> -->

== Symptoms ==
When people get Ebola the first [[symptom]]s look like some other diseases. People get a [[fever]] and feel very tired. Their [[headache|head]], [[stomach]], [[joint|joints]], and [[throat]] might hurt. Sometimes, people think they have other diseases like [[malaria]] or [[typhoid fever]].

Later, people get much sicker. They bleed both inside and outside their bodies. They have [[blood]] in their [[diarrhea]] and [[vomit]]. They bleed from their [[nose]]s, [[mouth]]s, and [[genital]]s/sex organs. They get [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]: low [[blood pressure]], fast pulse ([[heart]] rate), and low [[circulatory system|blood circulation]] to the body. Their [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] might stop working. Ebola also causes stiffness throughout the body which makes it hard for sick people to move. 

Five to nine out of every ten people who get sick with Ebola die.

== Treatment ==
There is no cure for Ebola, but if people get care quickly from [[Medical doctor|doctors]] and [[nurse]]s at a [[hospital]], more of them live. People with Ebola need a lot of fluids to replace fluids lost from [[diarrhea]], [[vomiting]], and bleeding. The most important care is giving them water with a very small amount of salt and sugar in it. This is called [[oral rehydration therapy|oral rehydration]]. It helps to replace their fluids and blood. It is also important to give medicines in case they get bad [[blood pressure]] and blood circulation.

== Prevention ==
Scientists have not yet found a vaccine for Ebola, but efforts are underway.

== Research ==
[[World Community Grid]] is a computing project that is seeking possible drug treatments. People donate the spare time on their computers to the project.

'''Ecology''' is the [[science]] which studies the [[biota]], the [[environment]], and their interactions. It comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''oikos'' = house; ''logos'' = study. 

Ecology is the study of [[ecosystem]]s. Ecosystems describe the web or network of relations among organisms at different scales of organization. Since ecology refers to any form of [[biodiversity]], ecologists research everything from tiny [[bacteria]] in [[nutrient]] [[recycling]] to the effects of [[tropical]] [[rain forest]]s on the [[Earth's atmosphere]].  Scientists who study these interactions are called ''ecologists''. 

[[Terrestrial ecoregion]] and [[climate change]] research are two areas where ecologists now focus.

There are many practical applications of ecology in [[conservation]] biology, [[wetland]] management, [[natural resource]] management ([[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[fishing|fisheries]]), city [[planning]] (urban ecology), [[community health]], [[economics]], and applied science. It provides a framework for understanding and researching human social interaction.<ref>Omerod S.J. Pienkowski M.W. & Watkinson A.R. 1999. Communicating the value of ecology.

== Ecology in politics ==
Ecology starts many powerful philosophical and political movements - including the conservation movement, wellness movement, environmental movement, and ecology movement we know today. When these are combined with [[peace]] movements and the Six Principles, they are called [[green]] movements. In general, these put [[ecosystem health]] first on a list of human moral and political priorities, as the way to achieve better human health and social harmony, and better [[economics]]. 

People with these beliefs are called political ecologists. Some have organized into the Green Parties, but there are actually political ecologists in most political parties. They very often use arguments from ecology to advance [[policy]], especially [[forest]] policy and energy [[policy]].

Also, ecology means that it is the branch of biology dealing with the relations and interactions between organisms and their environment, including other organisms.

== Ecology includes economics ==
Many ecologists also deal with human economics:

* [[Lynn Margulis]] says that economics studies how humans make a living, while ecology studies how every other animal makes a living.
* [[Mike Nickerson]] says that "economy is three-fifths of ecology", since ecosystems create resources and dispose of waste, which the economy assumes is done "for free".

Ecological [[economic]]s and human development theory try to separate the economic questions from others, but it is difficult. Many people think economics is just part of ecology now, and that economics that ignores it is wrong. "Natural [[capital (economics)|capital]]" is an example of one [[theory]] combining both.

== Ecology and anthropology ==
Sometimes ecology is compared to [[anthropology]]. Anthropology includes how our bodies and minds are affected by our environment, while ecology includes how our [[environment]] is affected by our bodies and minds. There is even a type of anthropology called ecological anthropology, which studies how people interact with the environment. 

Antoine de Saint-Exupery stated: "The earth teaches us more about ourselves than all the books. Because it resists us. Man discovers himself when he measures himself against the obstacle".

'''Economics''' is the [[social science]] which studies economic activity: how people make [[choice]]s to get what they [[want]]. It has been defined as "the study of scarcity and choice" and is basically about individual choice. It also studies what affects the production, distribution and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]  of goods and [[service (economics)|services]] in an economy.

[[Investment]] and [[income]] relate to economics.<ref>Krugman, Paul; Robin Wells (2012) ''Microeconomics: Second Edition in Modules'' Worth Publishers page 2</ref> The word comes from [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]], and relates to οἶκος oíkos "house" and νόμος nomos "custom" or "law".<ref name="etymology">{{cite web | last = Harper | first = Douglas | authorlink = Douglas Harper | title = Online Etymology Dictionary&nbsp;— Economy | date = November 2001 | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=economy | accessdate=October 27, 2007}}</ref> The [[Scientific model|model]]s used in economics today were mostly started in the 19th century. People took ideas from the field of [[political economy]] because they wanted to use an [[empiricism|empirical]] approach similar to the one used in the [[natural sciences]].<ref name="Clark">Clark, B. (1998). ''Political-economy: A comparative approach''. Westport, CT: Preager.</ref>

== Subjects and objects in economics ==
The subjects in economic study are households, business companies, the government (the state), and foreign countries. '''Households''' offer their "[[factors of production]]" to companies. This includes work, land, [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (machines, buildings) and information. They get income which they use to buy or 'consume' goods. 

'''Business companies''' produce and sell [[Good (economics)|goods]] and buy factors of production from households and from other companies. 

'''The state''' or [[public sector]] includes institutions and organisations. The state takes some of the earnings from the business companies and households, and uses it to pay for "public goods" like [[street]]s or [[education]], to be available for everyone. The last subject is '''foreign countries'''. This includes all households, business companies and state institutions, which are not based in one's own country. They demand and supply goods from abroad.

The objects in economic study are [[consumer]] goods, capital goods, and factors of production. Consumer goods are classified as "usage goods" (for example, gasoline or toilet paper), as "purpose goods" (for example, a house or bicycle), and as "services" (for example, the work of a doctor or cleaning lady). Capital goods are goods which are necessary for producing other goods. Examples of these are buildings, equipment, and machines. Factors of production are work, ground, capital, information, and environment.

== General economic rules ==
* All people have to decide between their options.
* The cost of goods is what a person gives up for the goods.
* When a person gives up something (like money) to get a good, they also give up other things that they could have gotten instead.  This means that the true cost of something is what you give up to get it.  This includes [[money]], and the economic benefits (utility) that you didn't get because you can no longer buy something else.This is called [[opportunity cost]].
* People react to encouragements. Making an option more attractive will make more people choose it.
* Trade can make everyone better off.
* Markets are usually good for the organisation of economic life. In the [[free market]], goods will be shared by people and companies making small decisions. The “invisible hand” of the market ([[Adam Smith]]) states that if everyone tries to get what they want, everyone will be as well-off as they could possibly be.
* Sometimes prices do not fully show the cost or benefit to society. For example, [[air pollution]] is bad for society, and education is good for society. The government can put a tax (or do something to reduce sales) on items that are bad for society. It can also support (like giving money for) items that are good for society.
* The living standard of a country depends on the skills to produce services and goods. Productivity is the amount of the produced goods divided by total working hours. 
* When there is an increase in the total money supply, or when the cost to produce things rises, prices go up. This is called [[inflation]].

== History ==
* [[18th century]] analysis of [[wealth]]
** [[Physiocracy]]
* [[classical economics]]
* [[Marxist economics]]
* [[Austrian economics]]
* [[neoclassical economics]]
* [[welfare economics]]

Economists are strongly influenced by the times they live in.  For example, [[Karl Marx]] lived in a time where [[worker]]s' conditions were very poor, and [[John Maynard Keynes]] lived through the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. Today's economists can look back and understand why they made their judgements, and try to make better ones.

== Branches of economics ==
The two main branches of economics are [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomics]].  

Macroeconomics is about the economy in general.  For example, if a country's wealth goes up or if millions of people become unemployed, those are things that macroeconomists study.  Microeconomics is about smaller and more specific things such as how families and households spend their money.

There are a number of other branches of economics:
* [[Behavioral economics]]
* Business economics
* [[Constitutional economics]]
* [[development economics]]
* [[ecological economics]]
* [[economic geography]]
* [[environmental economics]]
* [[energy economics]]
* [[financial economics]]
* industrial economics
* [[information economics]]
* [[international economics]]
* [[labor economics]]
* [[managerial economics]]
* mathematical economics or econometrics
* [[resource economics]]
* [[urban economics]]
* [[public economics]]
* descriptive, theoretical and policy economics
* monetary economics

== Famous economists ==

Famous economists in history include:
* [[Adam Smith]] (considered to be the father of economics; he supported [[free market]]s).
* [[Thomas Malthus]] (he wrote about how a high population can affect the economy badly).
* [[Karl Marx]] (he wrote a book called [[The Communist Manifesto]]; he supported [[communism]]).
* [[John Maynard Keynes]] (he created a popular economic theory called [[Keynesian economics]]).
* [[Milton Friedman]] (he wrote a lot about [[monetarism]] and the [[money supply]]).

Famous economists of the 19th and 20th century include [[Léon Walras]], [[Carl Menger]], [[N. Gregory Mankiw]] and [[Friedrich August von Hayek]].

[[File:Brom amp.jpg|thumb|[[Bromine]] is one of only two elements that are liquid, at 25°C. The other is [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]<ref name=ryan />]]

A '''chemical element''' is a [[substance]] that contains only one type of [[atom]].  If a substance contains more than one type of atom, it is a [[chemical compound|compound]]. An element can be a solid, liquid or gas. The smallest [[particle]] of such an element is an [[atom]]. Atoms are made up of [[protons]], [[neutron]]s, and [[electron]]s.

Each element contains only one kind of atom.<ref name=brand /> The number of protons in an atom is called the [[atomic number]]. For example, all atoms with 6 protons are of the chemical element [[carbon]], and all atoms with 92 protons are of the element [[uranium]].

The number of protons in the nucleus causes its [[electric charge]]. This fixes the number of [[electrons]] in its normal ([[ionization|unionized)]] state. The electrons in their [[atomic orbitals]] determine the atom's various [[chemical properties]]. 

Elements are the basic building blocks for all types of substances. When they are combined with each other, they can form [[molecules]].

118 different chemical elements are known to modern [[chemistry]]. 92 of these elements can be found in [[nature]],<ref name=ryan>{{cite book|author=Ryan, Lawrie|title=Chemistry for You: National Curriculum Edition for GCSE|edition=2|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=9780748762347|date=2001}}</ref> and the others can only be made in [[laboratory|laboratories]].

Chemical elements are commonly arranged in the [[periodic table]]. Where the elements are on the table tells us about their properties relative to the other elements.

==Chemical symbols==
Chemical elements are also given a unique ''chemical symbol''. Chemical symbols are used all over the world. This means that, no matter which language is spoken, there is no confusion about what the symbol means.<ref name=BBC /> Chemical symbols of elements come from their English or Latin names. For example, [[carbon]] has the chemical symbol 'C', and [[sodium]] has chemical symbol 'Na', after the Latin ''natrium''. [[Tungsten]] is called 'W' after its German name, ''[[wolfram]]''.<ref name=sl2/><ref name=BBC>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/ks3bitesize/science/chemical_material_behaviour/atoms_elements/revise3.shtml|title=BBC Bitesize: Science: Chemical and material behaviour: Atoms and elements: Chemical symbols|page=3|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2011-03-23}}</ref> 'Au' is the symbol for gold and it comes from the Latin word for gold, ''aurum''.<ref name=brand>{{cite book|author1=Brand, Ian|author2=Grime, Richard|title=Longman Chemistry 11-14|date=2002|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9780582447554}}</ref><ref name=cd>{{cite book|author=Kidd, D. A.|title=Collins Pocket Latin Dictionary|publisher=Collins|date=2008|isbn=9780007263745}}</ref> Another symbol which comes from Latin is 'Ag'. This is the element [[silver]] and it comes from the Latin ''argentum''.<ref name=cd /> [[Lead]]'s symbol, 'Pb', comes from the Latin ''plumbum''<ref name=cd /> and the English word [[Plumbing|plumber]] derives from this as pipes used to be made out of lead.<ref name=ryan /> Others were named after famous people, like [[einsteinium]], which was named after [[Albert Einstein]].<ref name=sl2/>

==Compounds==
Elements can join (react) to form pure [[Chemical compound|compounds]] (such as [[water]], [[salt]]s, [[oxide]]s, and [[organic compound]]s). In many cases, these compounds have a fixed composition and their own [[structure]] and [[property|properties]]. The properties of the compound may be very different from the elements it is made from. [[Sodium]] is a [[metal]] that burns when put into water and [[chlorine]] is a poisonous gas. When they react together they make ''sodium chloride'' ([[salt]]) which is harmless and edible.

==Mixtures==
Some elements, particularly metal elements mix together in any [[proportion]] to form new structures. Such new structures are not compounds. They are called [[mixture]]s.

==Isotopes==
Most elements in nature consist of atoms with different numbers of neutrons.<ref name=salters>{{cite book|page=17|editor1=Otter, Chris|editor2=Stephenson, Kay|title=Salters Advanced Chemistry: Chemical Ideas|publisher=Heinemann|date=2008|edition=Third|isbn=978-0-435631-49-9}}</ref> An [[isotope]] is a form of an element with a certain number of neutrons. For example, carbon has two stable, naturally occurring isotopes: [[carbon-12]] (6 neutrons) and [[carbon-13]] (7 neutrons). [[Carbon-14]] (8 neutrons) is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of carbon. Of each element, except for [[Ununoctium]], at least two isotopes are known.

== Classification ==
Elements can be classified based on [[States of matter|physical states]]. At room temperature and pressure, most elements are [[solid]]s, only 11 are [[gas]]es and 2 are [[liquid]]s.

Elements can also be classified into [[metal]]s and [[non-metal]]s. There are many more metals than non-metals.

However, a few elements have properties in between those of metals and non-metals. These elements are called [[semimetal]]s (or metalloids).

{{for|the ancient civilization|Ancient Egypt}}

'''Egypt''' is a [[country]] in northeast [[Africa]]. Its capital city is [[Cairo]]. Egypt is famous for its [[Ancient history|ancient]] [[monument]]s, such as the [[Egyptian pyramids|Pyramids]] and the [[Sphinx]].

==History==
Egypt has been an independent country since 1922. It is a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Arab League]]. It was a [[republic]] from 1952 after the [[revolution]] of 1952 led by [[general officer|General]] [[Muhammad Naguib]], who became the first [[President]].

==Geography==
Egypt, is a large country, but a large portion of it is [[desert]]. Most people live in areas around the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and along the [[Nile]] River. This includes the cities of [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]], [[Aswan]], and [[Port Said]]. Not many people live in the desert. Today, Egypt has about 90 million people.

Egypt is divided into 29 areas, called [[Governorates of Egypt]].

==Politics==
Egypt is a country which has had many different rulers and many political systems. Here is a summary of its political history since [[World War II]]. After this war, Egypt was ruled by a king, [[Farouk of Egypt]] (11 February 1920 – 18 March 1965). He was the last ruler of the [[Muhammad Ali Pasha|Muhammad Ali]] [[dynasty]].

Farouk was overthrown on 23 July 1952 by a military coup. The coup was led by Muhammad Naguib, and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. From then on, Egypt had military rulers or rulers who had the backing of the army and many citizens. 

Nasser became President, from 1956 to 1970. Later rulers were [[Anwar Sadat]], and [[Hosni Mubarak]]. After Mubarak came a change. In 2012, an attempt was made to have a democratic election for the post of President. The winner was the [[Moslem Brotherhood]] candidate, [[Mohamed Morsi]]. The events which followed are still controversial, but one aspect stands out. Morsi issued a declaration that in effect gave him unlimited powers. He had the power to legislate (make laws) without any legal overview by the courts. This caused widespread protests. On 3 July 2013 he was unseated by a military coup council (a [[coup d'état]]). After an election in June 2014, [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] became President of Egypt. Islamist movements, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, rejected the change of regime as a military coup, and not democratic. 

Mohamed Morsi is currently under sentence of death, though this may not be carried out.

=== Revolution of 2011 ===
{{Main|2011 Egyptian revolution}}
In January 2011, thousands of [[protest]]ers gathered in [[Cairo]]. They wanted [[Hosni Mubarak]] to leave office. He had been the [[President]] for almost 30 years. On February 11, 2011, [[Vice President]] [[Omar Suleiman]] made an announcement. He said that Mubarak agreed to leave office.<ref name="MebarakResignes">{{cite news |title=Mubarak Resigns as Egyptian President |first=Ahmed A  |last=Namatalla |coauthors=Mariam Fam and Zainab Fattah |newspaper=Bloomberg |date=2011-02-11 |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-11/mubarak-leaves-presidency-hands-power-to-egypt-s-military-suleiman-says.html |accessdate=2011-02-11 }}</ref>

== Demographics ==
=== Religion ===
Today, the people of Egypt are mostly [[Sunni Muslims]]. There are still many Christians in Egypt today. Many of these belong to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].

=== Languages ===
The official language in Egypt is [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. A high percentage of the population, however, speaks [[English language|English]]. [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]] are also taught in Egypt as second language.

==Famous people==
Many famous people are from Egypt. Some of these include [[Omar Sharif]], who was an international actor, [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]], who was the first person from [[Africa]] to lead the [[United Nations]], and four [[Nobel Prize]] winners: [[Anwar Sadat]], who won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1978, [[Naguib Mahfouz]], who won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1988, [[Ahmed Zewail]], who won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1999, and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005.

==Governorates==
Egypt is divided into 27 [[governorates]]. The governorates are divided into regions. The regions have towns and villages. Each governorate has a capital. Sometimes capital has the same name as the governorate.

== Culture ==
Egypt is a country with an immense cultural mix. There are many differences between life in the countryside as compared with life in the large cities. There are differences between the families which are [[Muslim]], and the smaller number which are [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christians]]. There are noticeable differences in the standards of education. Families are close-knit, and look after each other.

== Tourism ==
[[File:Giza Plateau - Pyramid of Menkaure.JPG|thumb|Pyramid of Menkaure|236x236px]]
Tourism is one of the most important national incomes in Egypt. In 2008, about 12 million tourists visited Egypt providing nearly $12 billion of national income to Egypt. Tourism affects the economy of the country as a whole.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/10/20/ozabs-tourism-egypt-idAFJOE59J0PG20091020?sp=true "Egypt tourism numbers to fall less than feared"], Reuters Africa. (2009-10-20)</ref>

[[Giza Necropolis]] is one of Egypt's iconic sites. It is a popular destination for tourists to visit. It includes the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World]].

== Transport ==
There are methods of transport in Egypt.

=== Metro ===
[[File:Cairo Metro Sadat plathome.jpg|thumb|238x238px|Cairo Metro, Sadat Station]]
[[Cairo Metro]] is one of the most important projects in Egypt. It consists of 3 lines. Metro is the most preferable transport in Egypt due to persistent major traffic jams in the streets of Cairo.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/world/middleeast/cairos-subway-is-efficient-orderly-and-dependable.html "Underground, Everything That Life Above Is Not"], NY Times.

[[Category:Egypt| ]]'''Everything2''' or '''E2''' is a [[website]].  It lets people make pages about many different things, and some people use it as a [[diary]].

E2 users create pages called ''nodes'' and add stuff in ''writeups''.  Only logged-in users can create writeups.  Only the person who created the writeup or someone who the website owners (called "gods") choose can edit the writeup.  On the other hand, on [[Wikipedia]], anyone can edit pages, but on Everything2 only those who can edit the writeup can edit pages.

Everything2 does not require a [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] like Wikipedia does. So, it is possible to have more than one article (writeups) under the same title (node), each by different authors, and presenting different points of view.

An '''editor''' is a person who makes changes to [[wikt:document|document]]s.

The word ''editor'' can also mean:
* a [[text editor]], which is an [[computer program|application program]] for editing an electronic [[Writing|text]] or [[wikt:simple:media|media]] document
* a [[machine]] for editing [[video|video tape]] or [[movie]] film
* a film editor, who is a person who edits [[movies]]
* a person who edits texts; see [[copy editing]]

{{disambig}}'''Ecological yield''' is the harvestable [[growth]] of an [[ecosystem]].  It is most commonly measured in [[forestry]] - in fact [[sustainable forestry]] is defined as that which does not harvest more wood in a year than has grown in that year, within a given patch of forest.

However, the concept is also applicable to [[water]], and [[soil]], and any other aspect of an ecosystem which can be both harvested and renewed - the so-called [[renewable resource]]s.  The [[carrying capacity]] of an ecosystem is reduced over time if more than the amount which is "renewed" (refreshed or regrown or rebuilt).

The '''experience economy''' is the [[wikt:intangible|intangible]] [[service economy]] that customers experience directly.  In [[moral purchasing]], [[Natural Capitalism]] and other theories of how consumers make choices, they are actually choosing experiences or [[comprehensive outcome]microwave]s of their choices.  For instance to [[buy local]] is to choose a whole experience of local suppliers, such as in a [[farmers market]] or [[Slow Food]], that is quite different than the experience associated with [[factory food]] or [[fast food]].

[[Category:Economics]]
'''Execution''' is where [[state]] authorities [[kill]] someone for having committed an extremely serious [[crime]], usually [[treason]] or especially terrible [[murder]]s. In most [[country|countries]] where the [[death penalty]] is still provided for by [[law]], using it is an option available to the sentencing [[judge]]: even if the jury or judicial panel recommends the death penalty, the presiding judge still has the option to lock the convicted person in a [[prison]] for the rest of their life.


==Beheading==
[[Image:DelarocheLadyJaneGrey.jpg|thumb|[[Lady Jane Grey]], a probably innocent Queen of England is beheaded.]]
Beheading means cutting the convict's head off. It is one of the oldest execution methods and already mentioned in the [[Bible]]. Beheading used to be the standard method of execution in Scandinavia and Germany. Commoners were usually beheaded with an [[axe]] and noblemen with a [[sword]]. A special device, like [[guillotine]], can also be used, as in France. [[Nazi Germany]] used guillotine to execute criminal convicts, such as murderers.

Centuries ago many countries used beheading as an execution for important people, including England. In England, many noblemen and even some kings and queens have been beheaded. There, the prisoner would be led up the scaffold and usually say a speech. Then, he/she would be blindfolded and put his/her neck onto a block. Then, the executioner would lift up his axe and swing it down onto the victim's neck. If the executioner was skilled and the axe was sharp, then the axe would usually cut through the bone and organs of the victim in one stroke. But if the executioner was inexperienced, then it may take many strokes before the head would be cut off.

==Other ways of execution==
[[File:Edouard Manet 022.jpg|thumb|''The Execution of Emperor Maximilan of Mexico'' is a painting by [[Edouard Manet]]. It shows a firing squad.]]
Many countries do not allow executions as punishment any more, because it is too violent.  However, many states of the [[United States]] and some other foreign countries allow it.  Even in the United States, less violent ways of execution have had to be used.  Here are some other ways of execution other than hanging

*'''[[Lethal injection]]''':  Killing a person by placing several poisons in their blood.  This is used as the choice of execution in most U.S. states that allow executions.
*'''[[Gas chamber]]''': A person is placed in area where the air is filled with bad gases until he cannot breathe and dies.  This was used as an execution method in some U.S. states, and by the Nazis during the Holocaust.
*'''Electrocution''': Killing a person by placing them in an [[electric chair]] and giving them a very high electric shock.
*'''Firing Squad''':  Several people shoot and kill a person.  This execution was used in the state of [[Utah]] until recently, and was also often used in the United States [[Army]]. This method has been popular amongst the armies around the world, since guns and bullets are readily available. Firing squad was the lawful means of execution in [[Finland]] until 1944, when death penalty was abolished (stopped by the law). In most cases, not all the people firing have real bullets. After the execution, it is not possible to determine which of the people firing killed the person just executed.

== Old-fashioned methods ==
*'''[[Garrote|Garroting]]''', a method of strangulation used in [[Spain]] for hundreds of years.
*'''Crushing''', also called '''pressing''': used in the [[common law]] legal systems. A [[defendant]] who refused to plead ("stood mute") would be subjected to having heavier and heavier [[stone]]s placed upon his or her [[chest]] until a plea was entered or the person [[Suffocation|suffocated]].
*'''Hanging''': Using a rope to either break the convict's neck or to choke (strangulate) him.  Widely used around the world until the 20th century. Still today in use in some countries, such as [[Iraq]], [[Singapore]] and [[Japan]].
*'''Drawing and Quartering''':  A very violent form of execution common in Medieval and Renaissance Europe. It involved taking a person's organs out while he was still alive, then tying him to four horses going in different directions until his body is torn apart.  A similar thing is "breaking on the wheel", when a wheel rather than horses is used to tear a person's body apart
*'''Cruxifixion''': This method means literally nailing the convict on a [[cross]]. It is considered as the most painful and nasty method of all. It was used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] to punish traitors, rebels and runaway slaves. Death by this method may take days. The convict dies from blood loss, slow choking, loss of water and fever caused by muscle cramps. Besides the Roman and Persian Empires, this method was also used in feudal Japan.

[[Category:Crime]]
[[Category:Capital punishment]]The '''Flesch Reading Ease''' measures [[textual difficulty]], which indicates how easy a text is to [[read]].

Tools to calculate the Flesch Reading Ease include:

* [[Microsoft Word]]'s [[grammar]] check
* [[Abiword]] (open source)
* [[Koffice|KWord]] (open source)

==How it works==

The Flesch Reading Ease Scale measures readability as follows: 

100: Very easy to read. [[Average]] [[sentence]] length is 12 [[word|words]] or fewer. No words of more than two [[syllable|syllables]]. 

65: Plain English. Average sentence is 15 to 20 words long. Average word has two syllables. 

30: A little hard to read. Sentences will have mostly 25 words. Two syllables usually.

0: Very hard to read. Average sentence is 37 words long. Average word has more than two syllables. 

The higher the [[rating]], the easier the text is to understand. By the very nature of technical subject matter, the Flesch score is
usually relatively low for technical documentation. If the Flesch test is used regularly, one may develop a sense of what a
reasonable score is for the type of documentation one is working on and aim to align with this score. The approach to calculating
the Flesch score is as follows: 

# Calculate the average sentence length, L. 
# Calculate the average number of syllables per word, N. 
# Calculate score (between 0-100%).

The Flesch score for this subsection is 61.

'''February''' is the second [[month]] of the [[year]], coming between [[January]] and [[March]], with 28 days in most years. In [[leap year]]s February has 29 days. In [[Sweden]] in [[1732]] the month had 30 days. This was to make the calendar match the rest of the world. In [[1930]] and [[1931]], February had 30 days in the [[Soviet Union]] because the government changed all the months to be 30 days long. The name comes either from the Roman god Februus or else from "februa", the festivals of purification celebrated in Rome every fifteenth of this month.

== The Month ==
[[File:Valentines Day Chocolates from 2005.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Chocolates for [[Valentine's Day]], [[February 14]].]]
February is one of the last two months to be added to the calendar at the beginning of the year (the other is January). This is because in the original [[Roman calendar]], the two months of [[winter]], when not much would happen in agriculture, did not have names.

February is the second month of the year, coming between [[January]] and [[March]], and is also the shortest month, with 28 days in a [[common year]], and 29 days in a [[leap year]]. February begins on the same day of the week as [[March]] and [[November]] in [[common year]]s, and on the same day as [[August]] in a [[leap year]]. Every year, February ends on the same day of the week as [[October]], and in common years, February also ends on the same day of the week as [[January]]. In a [[leap year]], February is the only month to begin and end on the same day of the week.

From circa 700 BC, when Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, added it to the calendar, February had 23 days and 24 days on some of every second year, until 46 BC when Julius Caesar assigned it 29 days on every fourth year and 28 days otherwise. [[Leap year]] Day, [[February 29]], is added in every year that can be divided equally by four, such as [[2012]] and [[2016]], but this does not apply when the year ending in "00" at the turn of the [[century]] does not divide equally into 400. This means that [[2000]] was a [[leap year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], but [[1900]] was not. This is where the [[Julian calendar]] calculated dates differently, as it always repeated [[February 29]] every four years.

February is a [[winter]] month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and a [[summer]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the [[season]]al equivalent of [[August]] in the other. In [[weather]] [[lore]], [[Groundhog Day]], in the [[United States]], is set to decide what the weather will be like for the rest of the [[winter]].

February's flower is the [[violet (plant)|violet]] and its [[birthstone]] is the [[amethyst]]. The meaning of the amethyst is sincerity. The [[zodiac]] signs for February are [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] ([[January 21]] to [[February 19]]), and [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]] ([[February 20]] to [[March 20]]).

[[Category:Basic English 850 words]]'''Financial capital''' is a form of [[capital (economics)|capital]]. It is things that have [[value]], but do not do anything by themselves. They are only valuable because people value (want) them. For example, [[money]] is a form of financial capital. You cannot do anything with money but it still has value.

Financial capital is used to pay for things, this is because there is always more of it and people always want it. This means that financial capital has a stable value and can be traded in most places and with most people.

Some forms of financial capital, such as [[stock]]s, [[gold]] or [[bond (finance)|bond]]s are not wanted by everybody. However they can be traded with people for money or another type of financial capital. Because of this, these forms of financial capital do not have a stable price. This means that some people try to make a [[profit]] by buying and selling these types of financial capital in a [[market]].

Some things are treated as financial capital, even though they do have a use. For example, some people buy and sell [[land]] but are not interested in doing anything with it. Some people think this sort of trade is bad because the land should be used and not just treated like money. Other types of capital, such as [[social capital]] and [[human capital]] are rarely treated like financial capital. This may be because they involve people. Treating useful capital like financial capital is called [[comodification]].

In [[politics]], a common question is how often the government should use financial capital. In particular, should the government use financial capital to make a profit? Traditionally, [[liberal]] [[politicians]] do not mind this kind of trading for profit, but [[socialist]] or [[conservatism|conservative]] politicians are against it.

[[Category:Finance]][[File:LeeSmolinAtHarvard.JPG|thumb|Lee Smolin, creator of the Fecund universes theory]]
'''Fecund universes''' is a [[multiverse]] [[theory]] of [[Lee Smolin]].  It relies on [[models of our universe]] and [[statistics]] from [[astrophysics]] but is more correctly a theory of [[cosmology]].

In this theory, collapsing stars, or [[black hole]]s, are always [[creating]] new universes with slightly different [[laws of physics]].  Because these laws are only slightly different, each is assumed to be like a [[mutation]] of the original universe, as if each universe was a kind of [[single-celled organism]].  It would [[reproduce]] by "splitting" in some sense.

This theory relies on many [[models of our universe]] to model these "mutated" alternative universes, the ones that Smolin supposes are generated or "spun off" by [[black hole]]s. 

No [[human]] can ever be part of any of these "other" universes.  Observations from [[astrophysics]] can only say if the black holes exist or are common, and give some idea of how much the [[laws of physics]] can vary and still let the new universes produce new black holes.  

Smolin predicts that there would be many black holes in the universe humans can see, since they are likely in a very late born universe, by simple probability.  If there are many black holes, that is evidence for his theory, 

As this shows, [[cosmology]] has a very different [[standard of evidence]] and [[burden of proof]] than is required for [[models of our universe]] only, which humans (using mathematics) can observe and exchange [[knowledge]] on.

It is hard to separate science from [[religion]] on such questions.  It may be a simple matter of preference whether one wants to see one's universe as part of a system like [[biology]] or like [[mechanics]] - [[clockwork]].  Smolin's theory is important mostly because it challenges the [[mechanistic paradigm]].  

Even if it is wrong, it raises the idea that living beings might have to see their universe as also living to be able to understand or care about it at all.  Some compare Smolin's theory to [[Gaia philosophy]] which combines [[biology]], [[geology]] and [[ecology]] to explain the [[Earth]], our planet, as a living thing.  If both are right, humans are on a living planet in a living universe.  This idea is very appealing - which does not mean it is really "right".  Some think both are a kind of [[religion]].

[[File:Good Food Display - NCI Visuals Online.jpg|thumb|200px|Different kinds of foods.]]

'''Food''' is what people eat. Food usually comes from [[animal]]s or [[plant]]s. It is eaten by living things to provide [[energy]] and [[nutrition]].<ref>http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212568/food Definition</ref> Food contains the [[nutrition]] that people and animals need to be healthy. It contains [[protein]], [[fat]], [[carbohydrate]]s, [[vitamin]]s, and [[Dietary mineral|minerals]]. Liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called "[[drink]]s".

Food for humans is mostly made through [[farming]] or [[gardening]]. It includes animal and vegetable sources. Some people refuse to eat food from animal origin, like meat, eggs, and products with milk in them. Not eating meat is called [[vegetarianism]]. Not eating or using any animal products is called [[veganism]].

Food produced by farmers or gardeners can be changed by industrial processes (the [[food industry]]). Processed food usually contains several natural ingredients and [[food additive]]s (such as [[food preservation|preservative]]s, antioxidants, emulsifiers, flavour enhancers, etc.).

At home, food is prepared in the [[kitchen]], by the [[cooking|cook]]. The cook sometimes uses a [[cookbook]]. Examples of cooking utensils are [[pressure cooker]]s, [[pot]]s, and [[frying pan]]s.

Food can also be prepared and served in [[restaurant]]s or [[refectory]] (in particular for kids in school).

The utensils used may be a [[plate]], [[knife]], [[fork]], [[chopsticks]], [[spoon]], [[bowl]], or [[spork]].

Many people do not grow their own food. They have to buy food that was grown by someone else. People [[trade|buy]] most of their food in [[shop]]s or [[market]]s. But some people still grow most or all of their own food.

People may buy food and take it home to [[cooking|cook]] it. They may buy food that is ready to eat from a [[market|street vendor]] or a [[restaurant]].

== Food-related issues ==
Food shortage is still a big problem in the world today. Many people do not have enough money to buy the food that they need. Bad [[weather]] or other problems sometimes destroy the growing food in one part of the world. When people do not have enough food, we say that they are [[hunger|hungry]]. If they do not eat enough food for a long time, they will become [[disease|sick]] and die from [[starvation]]. In areas where many people do not have enough food, we say that there is [[famine]] there. 

Food and water can make people [[Illness|sick]] if it is contaminated by [[microorganism]]s, [[bad metals]], or chemicals.

If people do not eat the right foods, they can become sick. 
*If people do not eat enough protein, they get the disease called [[kwashiorkor]]. 
*If they do not eat enough [[thiamine|vitamin B1]] ([[thiamine]]), they get the disease called [[beriberi]].
*If they do not eat enough [[ascorbic acid|vitamin C]], they get the disease called [[scurvy]].
*If [[child]]ren do not eat enough [[vitamin D]], they get the disease called [[rickets]].
If people eat too much food, they can become [[overweight]] or [[obesity|obese]]. This is also bad for people's health.

== Food in religions ==
Many cultures or [[religion]]s have food taboos. That means they have rules what people should not eat, or how the food has to be prepared. Examples of religious food rules are the ''[[Kashrut]]'' of [[Judaism]] and the ''[[Halal]]'' of [[Islam]], that say that [[pig]] meat cannot be eaten. In [[Hinduism]], [[beef]] is not allowed to be eaten. Some Christians believe to be ''vegetarian'' (Someone that doesn't eat meat)

When agreeing to a [[contract]] with a business, a customer may agree to certain rules. If the customer breaks the rules, then they agree to pay a fine for doing so.

'''Fish''' (plural: fish or fishes) are [[vertebrate]]s which live in water and [[respiration|respire]] (get [[oxygen]]) with [[gills]]. They lack [[limb]]s with digits (fingers & toes). This is a [[definition]] which does not quite work: some [[amphibia]] also live in water and have external gills, but they are not fishes.  

Fish used to be a [[class (biology)|class]] of [[vertebrates]].  Now the term covers five classes of aquatic vertebrates:
:[[Agnatha|Jawless fish]]
:†[[Placodermi|Armoured fish]]
:[[Chondrichthyes|Cartilaginous fish]]
:[[Actinopterygii|Ray-finned fish]]
:[[Sarcopterygii|Lobe-finned fish]]

There are more fish than [[tetrapods]] (land vertebrates): there are over 33,000 described species of fish.<ref>FishBase. [http://www.fishbase.org/search.php]</ref> Fish are usually covered with scales. They have two sets of paired [[fins]] and several unpaired fins. Most fish are cold-blooded ([[poikilotherm]]). A fish takes in the [[oxygen]] from the water using [[gills]]. There are many different kinds of fish. They live in [[fresh water]] in [[lake]]s and [[river]]s, and in [[salt water]] in the [[ocean]]. Some fish are less than one [[centimeter]] long. The largest fish is the [[whale shark]], which can be almost 15 [[metre|meters]] long and weigh 15 [[ton]]s. Most fish live in the water. A group of fish called the [[lungfish]] have developed [[lung]]s because they live in rivers and pools which dry up in certain parts of the year. They burrow into mud and [[aestivation|aestivate]] until the water returns.

'Fish' is a [[paraphyletic]] term in [[cladistics]] because it lacks a [[monophyletic]] group of descendants. It does not include the land vertebrates or [[tetrapod]]s, which descended from fish.

== Fish or fishes? ==
Though often used interchangeably, these words have different meanings. '''''Fish''''' is used either as singular noun or to describe a group of specimens from a single species. '''''Fishes''''' describes a group of different species.<ref name=Helfman>Helfman G. ''et al'' 2009. [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/helfman/ ''The diversity of fishes: biology, evolution, and ecology''] Wiley-Blackwell. ISBN 978-1-4051-2494-2</ref>

== Types of fish ==
Fish, the oldest vertebrate group, includes a huge range of types, from the Middle [[Ordovician]], about 490 million years ago, to the present day. These are the main groups:<ref name=Helfman/><ref>Moyle P.B. and Cech J.J. 2003. ''Fishes: an introduction to Ichthyology''. 5th ed, Cummings. ISBN 978-0-13-100847-2</ref><ref>Maisey J.G. 1996. ''Discovering fossil fishes''. Holt N.Y.</ref>

''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA)'' '''107''':19137-19138. [http://www.pnas.org/content/107/45/19137.full.pdf+html]</ref>
** [[Pteraspid]]s: the head-shields
** [[Anaspid]]s: gills opened as holes. [[Silurian]] to end-[[Devonian]].
*** [[Cephalaspid]]s: early jawless fish
*** [[Lamprey]]s: living ectoparasites
** [[Osteostraci]]: bony-armoured jawless fish.
* [[Gnathostomata]]: the jawed fish. Includes all types commonly called fish, except the lamprey.
** [[Placoderm]]s: heavily armoured fish
** [[Chondrichthyes]]: cartilaginous fish: [[shark]]s, [[ray]]s and [[skate]]s.
** [[Acanthodii]]: extinct spiny sharks
* [[Osteichthyes]]: bony fish.
** [[Actinopterygii]]: the [[ray-finned fish]].
*** [[Chondrostei]]: [[sturgeon]]s and some other early types.
*** [[Neopterygii]]: first seen in the later Permian, lighter and faster-moving than previous groups.
**** [[Holostei]]: the [[gar]]s and [[bowfin]]s
**** [[Teleost]]ei: the most successful group, [[Triassic]] to present day.
** [[Sarcopterygii]]: the [[lobe-finned fish]]
*** [[Dipnoi]]: the [[lungfish]]; eight [[genera]] survive.
*** [[Coelacanth]]s: two [[species]] survive. They were probably a [[sister-group]] to the [[tetrapod]]s.

Certain animals that have the word ''fish'' in their name are not really fish: [[Crayfish]] are [[crustacean]]s, and [[jellyfish]] are [[Cnidaria]]ns. Some animals look like fish, but are not. [[Whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s are [[mammal]]s, for example.

== Anatomy ==

=== Bony and cartilagenous fish ===
Most kinds of fish have [[bone]]s. Some kinds of fish, such as [[shark]]s and [[ray]]s, do not have real bones (their [[skeleton]]s are made of [[cartilage]]) they are known as [[cartilaginous fish]].

=== Fish scales ===
All fish are covered with overlapping [[Scale (zoology)|scales]], and each major group of fish has its own special type of scale. Teleosts ('modern' fish) have what are called ''leptoid'' scales. These grow in concentric circles and overlap in a head to tail direction like roof tiles. Sharks and other chondrichthyes have ''placoid'' scales made of denticles, like small versions of their teeth. These also overlap in a head to tail direction, producing a tough outer layer. Shark skin is available for purchase as [[shagreen]], a leather which as original is smooth in one direction, and rough in the other direction. It may be polished for use, but is always rough in texture and resistant to slipping.

The scales are usually covered with a layer of [[slime]] which improves passage through the water, and makes the fish more slippery to a [[predator]].

== Swimming ==
Fish swim by exerting force against the surrounding water. There are exceptions, but this is usually done by the fish contracting muscles on either side of its body in order to generate waves of flexion that travel the length of the body from nose to tail, generally getting larger as they go along. Most fishes generate thrust using lateral movements of their body & tail fin (caudal fin). However, there are also species which move mainly using their median and paired fins. The latter group profits from the gained manoeuvrability that is needed when living in coral reefs for example. But they can not swim as fast as fish using their bodies & caudal fins.<ref>Breder C.M. 2003. The locomotion of fishes. ''Zoologica'', '''4''', 159-256, (1926); ''Journal of Experimental Biology'' '''206''', 2749-2758 (2003)</ref>

=== Muscle ===
Fish can swim slowly for many hours using red muscle fibres. They also make short, fast bursts using white muscle. The two types of muscle have a fundamentally different [[physiology]]. The red fibres are usually alongside a much greater number of white fibres.

The white fibres get their energy by converting the [[carbohydrate]] [[glycogen]] to lactate ([[lactic acid]]). This is [[anaerobic metabolism]], that is, it does not need [[oxygen]]. They are used for fast, short bursts. Once the lactic acid builds up in the muscles, they stop working, and it takes time for the lactate to be removed, and the glycogen replaced.<ref name=McN>Alexander, R. McNeill. 1974. ''Functional design in fishes''. London: Hutchinson, p31. ISBN 0-09-104751-X</ref> Using their white fibres, fish can reach speeds of 10 lengths per second for short bursts.<ref name=McN/>

Swimming for long periods needs oxygen for the red fibres. The oxygen supply has to be constant because these fibres only operate [[aerobic]]ally. They are red because they have a rich blood supply, and they contain [[myoglobin]]. Myoglobin transports the oxygen to the oxidising systems. Red muscle gets its energy by oxidising [[fat]], which weight for weight has twice as much energy as carbohydrate or protein.<ref name=McN/> Using their red fibres, fish can keep up a speed of 3{{ndash}}5 lengths per second for long periods.<ref name=McN/>

=== Swimming in groups ===
{{main|Shoaling and schooling}}
Many fish swim in groups.  Schools of fish can swim together for long distances, and may be chased by predators which also swim in schools. Casual groups are called 'shoals'.

== Body shape ==
The shape of the body of a fish is important to its swimming. This is because [[wikt:streamline|streamlined]] body shapes makes the water drag less. Here are some common fish shapes.

=== Streamlining ===
[[File:White shark.jpg|thumb|230px|right|alt=A smooth, rocket-shaped shark swims quickly through the water.|The rocket-shape of this shark makes it an efficient swimmer. It is fast over short distances.]]

The picture on the right shows a [[shark]]. This shark's shape is called ''fusiform'', and it is an ovoid shape where both ends of the fish are pointy. This is the best shape for going through water quickly.<ref>Nielsen, Knut Schmidt 1984. ''Scaling: why is animal size so important?'' Cambridge. Chapter 15</ref><ref>Baily, Jill 1997. ''How fish swim''. Benchmark, N.Y.</ref> Fishes with fusiform shapes can chase prey and escape predators quickly. Many live in the open ocean and swim constantly, like [[marlin]]s, [[swordfish]], and [[tuna]]. [[Ichthyosaur]]s, [[porpoise]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[killer whale]]s all have similar shapes. This is an example of [[convergent evolution]].

=== Eel-like ===
The long, ribbon-like shape of an [[eel]]'s body shows another shape.  This enables them to hide in cracks, springing out quickly to capture prey, then returning quickly to their hiding spot.

=== Flatfish ===
[[File:Flounder hawaii.jpg|thumb|230px|alt=a depressed flounder.|An adult flounder has both eyes on the upper side of its body.]]
[[Flatfish]] live on the bottom of the ocean or lake. Most use [[camouflage]]: they change colors to match the ocean floor.

=== Compressed ===
Fish with compressed shapes have flat, vertical bodies, with one eye on each side. They swim upright and can be very thin. They usually live in [[reef]]s where their flat bodies can slip in and out among the [[coral]]s, [[sponge]]s, and rocks, keeping hidden from predators. [[Marine angelfish|Angelfish]], [[surgeonfish]], and [[butterflyfish]] are all compressed fish.

== Fish as food ==
People eat many kinds of fish.  The fish that people eat most include [[carp]], [[cod]], [[herring]], [[perch]], [[sardine]]s, [[sturgeon]], [[tilapia]], [[trout]], [[tuna]], and many others.  A person who buys and sells fish for eating is called a [[fishmonger]].

The word ''to fish'' is also used for the activity of catching fish.  People catch fish with small [[Fishing net|nets]] from the side of the water or from small [[boat]]s, or with big [[Fishing net|nets]] from big boats.  People can also catch fish with [[fishing pole]]s and fishhooks with [[bait]].  This is often called [[angling]].  Anglers also different types of [[fishing lure]]s.  

{{Further|Fishing}}

== Fish as pets ==
Some people keep fish as [[pet]]s. [[Goldfish]] and [[Siamese Fighting Fish]] are popular types of pet fish. [[Koi]] and other ornamental fish are often kept by groups of people in public ponds for their beauty and calming nature.

[[File:Human Feet - female - bruised.jpg|thumb|200px|Woman's feet]]
[[File:Blausen 0411 FootAnatomy.png|thumb|170px|Illustration of bones in lower leg and foot]]

A '''foot''' (one ''foot'', two or more '''feet''') is a [[body]] part on the end of a [[leg]]. We use it when walking, and it is important for balance: it helps us stand straight. We also use it to [[kick]], in both [[fighting]] and [[sport]]s, [[football]] being an example.

People's hands and feet have the same shape: they both have five ''digits'' (the fingers and toes). Many other [[Vertebrate|animals with backbones]] also have five digits. The part of the foot which joins it to the leg is called the ''heel''. The bottom of the foot is called the ''sole''. Half the bones in our body are in the foot. Doctors who work with people's feet are ''podiatrists'' or ''chiropodists''.

Many [[animal]]s have feet, and there are many different sorts of foot. The hard foot of an [[undulate|ungulate]] is a [[hoof]]. When an animal has soft feet, or feet with soft parts on the underside, we often call it a ''[[paw]]''. 

In many societies, people like to cover the foot when they are with others, especially outside. In many cultures (for example [[North America]]n, [[Europe]]an, [[Japan]]ese and others) people wear clothing over the foot to keep it safe. This [[footwear]] has special names, for example ''sandals'', ''[[shoe]]s'', and ''[[boot]]s''. When people always wear footwear, especially in hot places or when they are very active, their feet can smell badly (''foot odour''). If footwear is too big or small, it can be bad for the feet when the person wears the shoe because it can cause long term damage. People who have foot, leg, and back problems can also get help from special shoes. 

People have different traditions in different parts of the world for when to wear footwear. For example, in much of Europe and [[Canada]], people usually do not wear their shoes or boots in a home or visiting. In the United States people often wear shoes inside a home. In Japan, people do not wear shoes in homes, and floors are often made of very soft materials, too soft for shoes. In cultures where people always wear shoes, people sometimes think it is bad not to wear them. Not wearing shoes can be good for the feet, especially for children's feet.

Conditions like [[Athlete's foot]] affect the feet, causing the feet to feel dry and cracked.

== Bones ==
In a human foot, there are 26 [[bone]]s. They are made up of 14 [[phalanges]] ([[toes]]), 5 [[metatarsals]] ([[sole]] bones) and 7 [[tarsals]] ([[ankle]] bones).

'''France''' ({{lang-fr|France}}), officially the '''French Republic''' ({{lang-fr|République française}}), is a [[country]] in [[Western Europe]]. Its [[capital (city)|capital city]] is [[Paris]]. It is a member of the [[European Union]]. It is known for its [[culture]], its many [[monument]]s and [[structure]]s, and places such as the [[Louvre]], the [[Eiffel Tower]], the [[Arc de Triomphe]], [[Giverny]], [[Mont Saint Michel]], [[Versailles]], and [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. France is divided into 13 ''[[Regions of France|régions]]'' that are further subdivided ''[[Departments of France|départements]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.france-property-and-information.com/France-regions.htm |title=Regions of France |accessdate=2010-08-03 |date=2008 |format=htm |publisher=French Property, Services and Information Ltd }}</ref>

== History ==
The name "France" comes from the [[Latin]] word ''Francia'', which literally means "land of the [[Franks]]" or "Frankland".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesunchronicle.com/articles/2008/04/20/features/3057797.txt|title=Origin of Francia|author=The Sun Chronicle|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref>

The borders of modern France are about the same as those of ancient [[Gaul]]. [[Celt]]ic Gauls inhabited Ancient Gaul. [[Julius Caesar]] conquered Gaul for [[Roman Empire|Rome]] in the 1st century BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/History/Roman_Empire.shtml|title=Caesar Conquered Gaul|work=discoverfrance.net|author=Discover France|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref> Eventually, the Gauls adopted [[Romance languages|Roman]] speech ([[Latin]], from which the [[French language]] evolved) and Roman culture. [[History of Christianity|Christianity]] first appeared in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. It became firmly established by the fourth and fifth centuries.

[[File:Map France 1477-fr.svg|thumb|left|France in 1477. Red line: Limit of the Kingdom of France; Light blue: the royal domain]]
In the 4th century AD, the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], principally the [[Franks]] invaded the Gauls. This is how the name ''Francie'' appeared. The modern name "France" comes from the name of the [[Capetian dynasty|Capetian]] Kings of France around Paris. The Franks were the first tribe of Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to  Christianity rather than [[Arianism]]. The French called themselves "the most Christian Kingdom of France".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wf-f.org/03-1-France.html|title=France used this pretext to call themselves this|author=wff|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref>

The [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843), divided [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Empire]] into three parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.francebalade.com/histo/carolin.htm|title=Division of Charlemagne's empire into three parts|author=France Balade|accessdate=3 August 2010}} {{fr icon}}</ref> The biggest area was Western Francia. It is similar to modern France.

The [[Carolingian]] [[dynasty]] [[rule]]d France until 987, when [[Hugh Capet of France|Hugh Capet]] became [[King of France]]. His descendants, the [[Capetian dynasty|Direct Capetians]], the [[House of Valois]] and the [[House of Bourbon]], [[wikt:unify|unified]] the country with many wars and dynastic inheritance. The monarchy was the most [[great power|power]]ful during the 17th century and the reign of [[Louis XIV of France]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uncg.edu/rom/courses/dafein/civ/timeline.htm|title=French History - Le Grand Siècle|author=UNCG|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref> At that time, France had the [[Demographics of France|largest population in Europe]]. The country had a big influence over European [[politics]], [[economy]], and [[culture]]. [[French language|French]] became the common language of [[diplomacy]] in international affairs. Much of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] happened in France. French scientists made big [[Science|scientific]] discoveries in the 18th century. France also [[invasion|conquered]] many [[French overseas collectivities|overseas possessions]] in the Americas, Africa and Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.understandfrance.org/France/History3.html|title=French colonies History|author=Understand France|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref>

France had a [[monarchy]] until the [[French Revolution]] in 1789. King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and his wife, [[Marie Antoinette]], were [[executed]] in 1793.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lucidcafe.com/library/95nov/antoinette.html|title=Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette's executions|author=Lucidcafé|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref> Thousands of other French citizens were also killed. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] took control of the Republic in 1799. He later made himself Emperor of the First Empire (1804–1814). His armies conquered most of [[Europe|continental Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleonguide.com/campind.htm|title=Campaigns of Napoleon Bonaparte|author=Napoleonguide.com|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref> The [[metric system]] was invented by French scientists during the French revolution.

After Napoleon's final defeat in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], another  monarchy arose. Later [[Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]] created the Second Empire in 1852. Louis-Napoléon was removed after the defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian war]] of 1870. The Third Republic replaced his [[regime]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intellego.fr/soutien-scolaire-3eme/aide-scolaire-Education-civique-juridique-et-sociale/Les-regimes-politiques-de-France-de-1780-a-nos-jours./31424|title=Regimes of France|author=Intellego|accessdate=3 August 2010}} {{fr icon}}</ref>

The large [[French colonial empire]] in the 19th century included parts of [[West Africa]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The culture and politics of these regions were [[influence]]d by France. Many [[colony|ex-colonies]] officially speak the [[French language|French]] language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alsintl.com/resources/languages/French/|title=French language in Colonies|author=alsintl.com|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref>

The country was where both the [[WWI|First]] and [[WWII|Second World Wars]] took place. During the [[First World War]], millions were killed in the trenches including over a million in the [[Battle of the Somme]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/somme.htm|title=Battle of the Somme|author=firstworldwar.com|accessdate=3 August 2010}}</ref> The conditions were very poor. The last surviving veteran was Pierre Picault who died on 20 November 2008 at the age of 109.<ref name="France">[http://dersdesders.free.fr/france.html Ders Des Ders Report - France] {{fr icon}}</ref>
During the Second World War, [[Nazi]]s [[wikt:occupy|occupied]] France. The Allies landed in Normandy on June 6, 1944 and began the [[Battle of Normandy]]. German forces lost France in just a few months.

== Divisions ==
[[File:France departements regions narrow.jpg|thumb|The 22 [[regions of France|regions]] ]] The 13 regions and 96 [[departments of France|departments]] of [[metropolitan France]] includes [[Corsica]] (''Corse'', lower right). The Paris area is expanded. France is divided into (administrative) [[region]]s. 22 of them are in [[Metropolitan France]]:
{|
|-
| valign="top" |
1. [[Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine]]<br />
2. [[Aquitaine-Limousin-Poitou-Charentes]]<br />
3. [[Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes]]<br />
4. [[Bourgogne-Franche-Comté]]<br />
6. [[Brittany]]<br />
7. [[Centre-Val de Loire]]<br />

11. [[Normandy]]<br />
12. [[Pays de la Loire]]<br />
13. [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]]<br />

|}
Corsica has a different status than the other 12 metropolitan regions. It is called ''[[collectivité territoriale]]''.

France also has five [[Overseas Regions of France|overseas regions]]:
:{|

# [[Guadeloupe]] (in the Caribbean)
# [[French Guiana]] (in South America)
# [[Martinique]] (in the Caribbean)
# [[Réunion]] (in the Indian Ocean).
# [[Mayotte]] (in the Indian Ocean)
These four overseas regions have the same status as the metropolitan ones. They are like the overseas American states of [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]].
|}
Then France is divided into 101 [[Departments of France|departments]]. The departments are divided into 342 [[Arrondissements of France|arrondissements]]. The ''arrondissements'' are re-divided into 4,032 [[Cantons of France|cantons]]. The smallest [[Administrative division|subdivision]] is the [[Communes of France|commune]]. On January 1, 2008, [[INSEE]] counted 36,781 communes in France. 36,569 of them are in [[metropolitan France]] and 212 of them are in [[overseas France]].<ref>{{fr icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/methodes/nomenclatures/cog/documentation.asp| title=Code officiel géographique – Présentation|first=[[Government of France]]| last=[[INSEE]]|accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref><ref>{{fr icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/methodes/default.asp?page=nomenclatures/cog/outremer.htm| title=Code des collectivités d'outre-mer (COM)|first=[[Government of France]]| last=[[INSEE]]|accessdate=2008-06-27}}</ref>

== Government ==
The government of France is  a [[semi-presidential system]] determined by the [[French Constitution]] of the French Fifth [[French Republic|Republic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Semi-presidential_system|title=France's political system}}</ref> The constitution declares the nation to be "an indivisible, [[secular]], [[Democracy|democratic]], and [[social]] [[Republic]]".

== Military ==
[[File:Gaule96.jpg|thumb|right|Nuclear [[aircraft carrier]] ''Charles de Gaulle'']]
[[File:French Republican Guard Bastille Day 2007 n4.jpg|thumb|upright|French Republican Guard]]

The French [[armed forces]] are divided into four branches:
* The ''Armée de Terre'' (Army)
* The ''Marine Nationale'' (Navy)
* The ''Armée de l'Air'' (Air Force)
* The ''Gendarmerie Nationale'' (A military force which acts as a [[National]] [[Rural]] [[Police]])

France has about 359,000 military personnel.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.csis.org/media/csis/pubs/060626_asia_balance_powers.pdf|title=Number of military personnel in France, page 32}}</ref><ref>{{Citeweb|url=http://www.csis.org/media/csis/pubs/westmb012302%5B1%5D.pdf|title=Number of military personnel in France, page 112}}</ref> France spends 2.6% of its [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) on [[defense (military)|defense]]. This is the highest in the [[European Union]]. France and the [[UK]] spend 40% of the EU defence [[budget]]. About 10% of France's defence budget is for its [[nuclear weapons]] force.

== Foreign relations ==
{{see also|European Union|United Nations Security Council}}

France is a member of the [[United Nations]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml#f|title=Members of the UN|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> It is a permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council]] and has [[veto]] rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/sc/members.asp|title=Members of the Security council|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 August 2010}}</ref> It is also a member of the [[World Trade Organisation]] (WTO).

In [[1953]], the [[United Nations]] asked France to choose a [[coat of arms]] to represent them internationally. The French emblem is now on their [[passport]]s.

France was a founding member of the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/index_en.htm|title=History of the EU|publisher=European Union|accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> In the 1960s, France wanted to exclude the [[United Kingdom]] from the [[organisation]]. It wanted to build its own [[Economy|economic]] [[Influence|power]] in continental [[Europe]].  France and [[Germany]] became closer after [[World War II]].  This was to try to become the most influential country in the EU.  It limited the influence of the new [[Eastern Europe]]an members. France is a member of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO).<ref name="nato" /> However, under [[Charles de Gaulle|President de Gaulle]], it left the joint military command. In the early 1990s, France received [[criticism]] for its underground [[nuclear weapons|nuclear]] tests in [[French Polynesia]]. France vigorously opposed the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2688117.stm|title=Opposition of the war in Iraq|publisher=BBC website|accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> France retains strong political and economic influence in its former [[Africa]]n colonies. For instance it has supplied economic aid and troops for peace-keeping missions in the [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Chad]].

== Economy ==

{{main|French literature}}
[[File:Dartagnan-musketeers.jpg|right|thumb|''The Three Musketeers'' by [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]]]]
French literature began in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/Literature/DF_literature.shtml|title=French literature started in the Middle Ages}}</ref> French was divided into several dialects at the time. Some authors [[spelling|spelled]] words differently from one other.

During the 17th century, [[Pierre Corneille]], [[Jean Racine]], [[Molière]], [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[René Descartes]] were the main authors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://17emesiecle.free.fr/Auteurs.php|title=French authors of the 17th century|author=17eme siecle|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>

In the 18th and 19th centuries, French literature and poetry reached its best. The 18th century saw writings of authors, [[essay]]ists and [[moral]]ists as [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].
As for French children's literature in those times, [[Charles Perrault]] wrote stories such as "[[Little Red Riding Hood]]", "[[Beauty and the Beast]]", "[[Sleeping Beauty]]" and "[[Puss in Boots]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perraultfairytales.com/en/stories|title=Perrault's tales|accessdate=2010-09-12|Publisher=PerraultFairyTales.com}}</ref>

=== Cuisine === <!-- [[French cuisine]] redirects here -->
[[File:Terrine de saumon au basilic.JPG|thumb|right|230px|Basil salmon [[Terrine (food)|terrine]]]]

French cuisine has influenced the style of cooking throughout Europe, and its chefs work in restaurants throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delices-du-monde.fr/recettes-francaise.html|title=Diversity of French Cuisine|accessdate=1 August 2010}}{{fr icon}}</ref>

The roots of modern ''haute cuisine'' lie in chefs like [[François Pierre La Varenne|La Varenne]] (1615–1678) and the notable chef of [[Napoleon]], [[Marie-Antoine Carême]] (1784–1833). These chefs developed a lighter style of food compared to the food of the [[Middle Ages]]. They used fewer spices, and more [[herb]]s and creamy ingredients.

Typical ingredients like [[roux]] and fish stock, and techniques such as [[marinade|marinading]], and dishes such as [[ragout]], were invented. Carême was an expert pâtissier (pastry-maker), and this is still a mark of French cooking. He developed basic sauces, his 'mother sauces'; he had over a hundred sauces in his repertoire, based on the half-dozen mother sauces.

French cuisine was introduced in the 20th century by [[Auguste Escoffier|Georges Auguste Escoffier]] (1846–1935). He was a genius at organisation. He worked out how to run large restaurants, as in a big hotel or a palace; how the staff should be organised; how the menu was prepared. He had methods for everything. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of ''Le Guide Culinaire'' in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. Escoffier managed the restaurants and cuisine at the [[Savoy Hotel]] and [[Carlton Hotel]] in [[London]], the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris]], and some of the greatest cruise ships.

Escoffier, however, left out much of the culinary character to be found in the [[regions of France]].

Gastro-tourism and the ''[[Guide Michelin]]'' helped to acquaint people with the rich [[bourgeois]] and peasant cuisine of the French countryside in the 20th century. [[Gascony|Gascon]] cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country. [[Cheese]] and [[wine]] are a major part of the cuisine, playing different roles regionally and nationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodcooking.com/frcheese.htm|title=French Cheeses|accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.franceway.com/cheese/|title=French Cheese|accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://trifter.com/practical-travel/world-cuisine/top-10-most-tasty-cuisines-in-the-world/|title=The world's best cuisines|accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref> In the [[north]] of France, people often prefer to use [[butter]] to [[wikt:cook|cook]]. In the [[south]], they prefer [[olive oil]] and [[garlic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jvmxWfyZ2tFVA3qcmC7DkX6SMi5g|title=Butter and oil in French Cuisine|accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref> In France, each [[Regions of France|region]] has its own special [[dish]]; [[choucroute]] in [[Alsace]], [[quiche]] in [[Lorraine]], [[cassoulet]] in the [[Languedoc-Roussillon]], and [[tapenade]] in [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]].

In November 2010, '''French gastronomy''' was added by [[UNESCO]] to its lists of the world's 'intangible cultural heritage'.<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/world/stories/DN-culture_17int.ART.State.Edition1.b21e71.html Bon appétit: Your meal is certified by the U.N.] Dallas Morning News</ref><ref>[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/celebrations_healing_techniques_crafts_and_culinary_arts_added_to_the_representative_list_of_the_intangible_cultural_heritage/ Celebrations, healing techniques, crafts and culinary arts added to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage]</ref>

Arter's own conclusions are only slightly more nuanced: "The adoption of a new constitution on 1 March 2000 meant that Finland was no longer a case of semi-presidential government other than in the minimalist sense of a situation where a popularly elected fixed-term president exists alongside a prime minister and cabinet who are responsible to parliament (Elgie 2004: 317)". According to the Finnish Constitution, the president has no possibility to rule the government without the ministerial approval, and does not have the power to dissolve the parliament under his or her own desire. Finland is actually represented by its prime minister, and not by its president, in the Council of the Heads of State and Government of the European Union. The 2012 constitution reduced the powers of the president even further.</ref>

[[File:Europe location FIN.png|thumb|240px|Finland on a map of Europe]]
'''Finland''' (''Suomi'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) is a [[country]] in Northern [[Europe]] and is a member state of the [[European Union]]. Finland is one of the [[Nordic countries]]. It is also part of [[Fennoscandia]]. Finland is between the 60th and 70th latitudes North. Its neighbours are [[Sweden]] to the west, [[Norway]] to the north, [[Russia]] to the east and [[Estonia]] to the south, beyond the sea called Gulf of Finland. Most of western and southern coast is on the shore of the [[Baltic Sea]].

The [[Capital (city)|capital]] of Finland is [[Helsinki]]. The [[currency]] of Finland is the [[euro]] (EUR); before 2002 it was the ''markka'', the Finnish mark (FIM). The [[president]] of Finland is [[Sauli Niinistö]]. 5.3 million people live in Finland. [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] are the official [[language]]s of Finland. Most people in Finland speak Finnish, but about six [[percent]] of Finland's people speak Swedish as their [[mother tongue]], living mostly in the western part of Finland and on [[Åland]] (Finnish Ahvenanmaa). Finland became [[Independence|independent]] of Russia in 1917.

The most important cities and towns in Finland are [[Helsinki]], [[Espoo]], [[Tampere]], [[Vantaa]], [[Turku]], [[Oulu]], [[Lahti]], [[Kuopio]], [[Jyväskylä]] and [[Pori]]. 

Finland is a highly industrialized [[First World]] country. The most important Finnish industrial products are [[paper]], [[steel]] products such as machines, and electronics.

[[Nokia]] (the mobile company) is originally a company of Finland, named after a small town called Nokia. 

Finland has been top of the list of least corrupt countries on the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] more times than any other country.

== People and culture ==
The people of Finland are called Finns. Most Finns speak [[Finnish language|Finnish]] as their mother tongue; 6% of Finns have the [[Swedish language]] as their mother tongue.  Finns also study mandatory English and Swedish in school. Most Finns work either in services (that is: shops, banks, offices or businesses) or in factories. Finns often like [[sauna]]s and [[nature]]. Many Finnish families have [[summer cottage|summer cottages]], small houses where they go to relax on their summer holidays. The most important [[festival]]s that Finnish people celebrate are [[Midsummer]] and [[Christmas]]. [[Santa Claus]] is an old Finnish tradition, although later the [[Coca-Cola]] company introduced him to the world.

The most popular sports in Finland are [[ice hockey]], [[skiing]], [[track and field]] and [[association football]] (soccer). Recently Finns have also won many events in [[swimming]], [[motor sports]] and [[gymnastics]].

There is a very small group (a minority) of a few thousand [[Sami people|Samis]] (also called Lapps) in the most northern part of Finland, called [[Lapland]]. Most of the Samis live in [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. Many Sami people farm [[reindeer]]s. Originally Samis were [[hunter-gatherers]]. In the past the Sami were [[nomad]]s, but nowadays they live in regular houses.

Very few people in Finland, approximately 2%, are from other countries, The number of foreigners in Finland has recently been growing rapidly.

== Nature and weather ==
[[File:Koli hill view.jpg|thumb|250|This picture is from [[Koli]], [[North Karelia]]]]
Most of Finland is covered by pine [[forest]]. The [[swan]], which was considered holy long ago, is the national bird of Finland. Wood is the most important natural resource of Finland. It is estimated that up to one-third of all wood resources of the European Union are in Finland.

The national animal of Finland is the brown bear. The largest animal is the [[elk]], a type of moose, which is a member of the deer family.

There are hundreds of rivers and thousands of fresh water lakes. [[Fishing]] is a popular [[sport]]. It is estimated there are almost 180,000 lakes in Finland.

Many islands in the [[Baltic Sea]] belong to Finland, too. Thousands of islands are part of the [[Åland]] [[archipelago]]. Tourists from all over the world come to see the fells and the [[Aurora|northern lights]] in [[Lapland]].

The highest mountain of Finland is Halti, which is 1328 meters high. The largest lake is Saimaa, 4,400 square kilometres. The longest river of Finland is Tornionjoki. The largest river (by watershed) is Kemijoki, 552 kilometres long.

The weather in Finland varies widely by season.  Summer usually lasts from May to early September, and temperatures can reach up to +35 °C.  Autumns are dark and rainy. Winter snow usually begins to fall in Helsinki in early December (in Lapland it can fall as early as October) and in the winter the temperature can drop to -30 °C.  Winter usually lasts to mid-March, when the snow melts in Helsinki (in Lapland the snow usually doesn't melt until early May), and Spring lasts till late May. Spring can be erratic, and the weather can change from frost to sunshine wthin a matter of days. The famed Northern Lights are common in Lapland.

== History of Finland ==
People first came to Finland 10,000 years ago. That was just after an [[ice age]], after a glacier that covered the ground had receded.

Some think the first people in Finland already spoke a language that is related to Finnish that is spoken today. It is known for sure that an early form of the Finnish language was spoken in Finland in the [[Iron Age]]. (The Iron Age in Finland was 2,500–800 years ago).

The first residents in Finland hunted animals, as "[[hunter-gatherer]]s".  Some people started to [[agriculture|farm]] crops about 5,200 years ago. Farming slowly became more and more popular and became the major way of life until the modern age. 

[[File:Vasarakirves.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Stone [[axe]] from Finland.]]

The ancient Finns were [[paganism|pagans]], like most Europeans, as well as most people everywhere. The most important god of the Finnish pantheon was [[Ukko]]. He was a god of [[sky]] and [[thunder]], much like [[Odin]], another Scandinavian god-king. These powers were common among the pagan god kings in pantheons ranging from the Finnish Ukko, to the Scandinavian/Germanic/Saxon [[Odin]], all the way east to [[Zeus]] of the Greeks and Jupiter of the Romans. 

Around a thousand years ago when most of Europe were adopting Christianity, eventually Finland followed suit.  During the [[Reformation]] of Christianity in the 16th century, most Finns became [[Protestant]]s. Some pagan practices still remain amongst the now Christian Finns, such as [[bear worship]].

From the [[Middle Ages]] Finland was a part of [[Sweden]]. Then, in the year [[1809]], [[Russia]] took Finland from Sweden. Finland was a part of Russia, but after a short period of time it became [[autonomy|autonomous]], which means that the Finns essentially controlled Finland, though the Tsar was in control officially. Finns could create their own laws and had their own currency, (called the ''[[markka]]''), their own [[stamp]]s and own [[custom]]s. However, Finland did not have its own [[army]].

[[File:Finnish soldiers during the Winter War.jpg|thumb|250px|Finnish soldiers at the time of war]] 
On 6 December 1917, Finland became independent, which meant that it no longer was a part of Russia. There was a [[October Revolution|communist revolution]] in Russia and after 1922 Russia was a part of the [[Soviet Union]]. There were [[Communism|communists]] in Finland too, who tried to create a revolution in Finland. This attempt at revolution caused the [[Finnish civil war]]. The communists lost the civil war, and Finland did not change its old capitalist system.

[[Stalin]], who was the leader of the Soviet Union, did not like having a capitalist country as its neighbour. Stalin wanted Finland to become a communist state and be a part of the Soviet Union. The leaders of Finland refused: they wanted to stay independent. The Soviet Union sent many troops across the eastern border of Finland to try to make Finland join them, which resulted in the [[Winter War]]. There were many battles, that eventually resulted in Finland losing areas along its eastern border to the Soviet Union.

[[Adolf Hitler]] was the dictator of Germany, and wanted to invade the Soviet Union. Finland wanted to retrieve the areas that it had lost, so they joined the German invasion, which started in 1941. This part of the [[Second World War]] is called the [[Continuation War]] in Finland. However, Finland was not a [[fascism|fascist]] or an [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] country. Finns were interested in freedom rather than dictatorship.

While Germany was losing the war, Finland had already progressed into the Soviet Union in order to regain the areas lost in the previous peace. Finland wanted to end the war with the Soviet Union, which resulted in peace, but once again Finland had to relinquish the areas that they had conquered. This time, the peace with the Soviet Union made Finland and Germany enemies. Finns fought Germans, and Germans retreated to [[Norway]], burning down all of Lapland behind them.  This is called War of [[Lapland]].  Finland remained independent.

After the war, many factories were built in Finland. Many people moved from farms to cities. At that time, big factories manufactured products like [[paper]] and [[steel]]. More and more people worked in more advanced jobs, like [[high technology]]. Also, many people went to universities to get a good education. Finland was one of the first countries where most people had [[Internet]] connections and mobile phones. A well-known company that makes [[mobile phone]]s, [[Nokia]], is from Finland.

Finland joined the [[European Union]] in 1995. The Finnish currency, the ''[[markka]]'' (mark), was changed to the European Union's currency, the [[euro]], in 2002.

== Economy ==
Finland has a mixed economy. [[Free market]] controls a lot of production and sales of goods, but public sector is involved in services. In 2013, taxes were 44% of gross national product. This is 4th largest in Europe, after Denmark, France and Belgium.<ref>[http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_valtiontalous.html Valtion talous] National Statistics</ref> 

In 2014 services were 70% of the gross national product.<ref>[http://www.stat.fi/tup/suoluk/suoluk_kansantalous.html Kansantalous] National Statistics</ref> 

The largest company  in 2014 was oil refinery [[Neste Oil]]. Second largest was  [[Nokia]]. It is expected to be the argest one again, as soon as purchase of [[Alcatel-Lucent]] is finished. Two forest industries  [[Stora Enso]] and [[UPM-Kymmene]], are numbers three and four. Number five is [[Kesko]] which sellls everyday goods in K-supermarkets.<ref name="TE500">[http://www.talouselama.fi/uutiset/suuryhtiot-puristivat-vahemmasta-liikevaihdosta-enemman-voittoa-3365520  Talouselämä 500, kymmenen suurinta] Talouselämä 27.2.2016</ref>

== Elections ==
[[Election]]s are [[organize]]d to select 200 [[wikt:member|member]]s to the [[Parliament]] of Finland. Also selected are the [[president]] of Finland, members of [[Town council|town]] and [[city council]]s and Finnish members to the [[European Parliament]]. The [[election]]s are [[secret]] and direct. People [[vote]] directly for the person they want to be elected. In presidential elections votes are only cast for a person, not for a [[political party]]. All the other elections are [[Proportional representation|proportional]]. The system is a combination of voting for individuals and parties.<ref name="CP">{{cite web |url=http://www.vaalit.fi/en/index/generalinformation/centralprinciplesofholdingelections.html |title=Central Principles of Holding Elections |author= |date= |website= Elections website |publisher= Ministry of Justice  |accessdate=6 February 2016}}</ref> The right to vote is universal and equal.  In general elections everybody has one vote.

[[Category:Nordic countries]][[File:Mature flower diagram.svg|thumb|400px|Diagram of flower, cut open, showing the [[ovary (botany)|ovary]]]] 

In [[botany]], a '''fruit''' is a plant structure that contains the plant's [[seed]]s. To a botanist, the word ''fruit'' is used only if it comes from the part of the [[flower]] which was an [[ovary (botany)|ovary]].<ref>Mauseth, James D. 2003. ''Botany: an introduction to plant biology''. Jones & Bartlett, Boston.</ref> It is an extra layer round the seeds, which may or may not be fleshy. However, even in botany, there is no general agreement on how fruits should be classified. Many do have extra layers from other parts of the flower.<ref>Schlegel, Rolf 2003. ''Encyclopedic dictionary of plant breeding and related subjects''. Haworth Press. ISBN 1-56022-950-0.</ref>

In general speech, and especially in [[cooking]], fruits are a sweet product, and many botanical fruits are known as [[vegetable]]s. This is how ordinary people use the words. On this page, we describe what botanists call a fruit.

The fleshy part of a fruit is called the mesocarp. It is between the fruit's skin (exocarp) and the seeds. The white part of an [[apple]], for example, is the "fleshy" part of the apple. Usually, when we eat a fruit, we eat the "fleshy" part.

== Types of fruits ==
[[File:Grapes.jpg|thumb|thumb|left|140px|alt=Grapes hanging on a branch|Grapes are berries]]

===Berry===
If the entire fruit is fleshy, except for maybe a thin skin, we call the fruit a [[berry]]. A berry might contain one seed or many. [[Grape]]s, [[avocado]]s, and [[blueberry|blueberries]] are berries. They all have a thin skin, but most of the fruit is fleshy. [[Strawberry|Strawberries]], however, are actually ''not'' berries, because the seeds are on the outside: on a real berry, the seed or seeds must be inside.

===Pepo===
A pepo (pronounced ''pee' po'') is a [[wikt:modify|modified]] berry. Its skin is hard and thick and is usually called a "rind". [[Pumpkin]]s and [[watermelon]]s, for instance, are pepos.

===Hesperidium===
[[File:Citrus fruits.jpg|thumb|170px|Citrus fruits are hesperidiums]]
A hesperidium is another modified berry. It has a [[leather]]y skin that is not as hard as the skin of a pepo. All [[citrus]] fruit like [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]] and [[lemon]] are hesperidiums.

===Pome===
[[File:PearPhoto.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Pears have a core surrounded by flesh, meaning pears are pomes]]

A [[pome]] (pohm) is a fruit that has a [[wikt:core|core]] surrounded by fleshy [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] that we can eat. The core is usually not eaten. Berries are different - the seeds are ''inside'' the fleshy part, not separated from it by a core. [[Apple]]s and [[pear]]s are pomes.

===Drupe===
[[File:Autumn Red peaches.jpg|thumb|170px|The big hard "pit" in the middle of this peach has a seed inside it]]
Drupes are also called [[stone fruit]]. A drupe is a fleshy fruit with a hard stone around the seed. We usually call this stone the "pit" of the fruit. [[Peach]]es and [[Olive (fruit)|olives]] are drupes. Actually, the [[almond]] fruit is a drupe, too, though we eat the seed that is inside the "pit" of the [[almond]] fruit.

== Botanical fruits ==
Since fruits are produced from fertilised ovaries in [[flower]]s, only [[flowering plant]]s produce fruits. Fruits are an [[evolution]]ary 'invention' which help [[seed]]s get [[wikt:dispersal|dispersed]] by animals.

The botanical term includes many that are not "fruits" in the common sense of the term. such as the vegetables [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[pumpkin]]s, [[cucumber]]s, [[tomato]], [[pea]]s, [[bean]]s, [[corn]], [[eggplant]], and [[sweet pepper]] and some spices, such as [[allspice]] and [[chillie]]s.

=== Accessory fruits ===
[[File:FraiseFruitPhoto.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Strawberry]] fruit: the 'seeds' are each derived from a [[pistil]] of the flower.]]
An accessory fruit or false fruit (pseudocarp) is a fruit in which some of the flesh is derived not from the ovary but from some adjacent tissue.

A fig is a type of accessory fruit called a syconium. [[Pome]]s, such as [[apple]]s and [[pear]]s, are also accessory fruits: the core is the true fruit.<ref>Esau K. 1977. ''Anatomy of seed plants''. Wiley New York.</ref>

== Non-botanical fruits ==
Strictly speaking, these are not botanical fruits: 
* any produced by non-flowering plants, like [[juniper]] berries, which are the seed-containing female cones of conifers.
* fleshy fruit-like growths that develop from other plant tissues (like [[rhubarb]]).

== Area of agreement ==
[[File:vaccinium.jpg|thumb|Berries which are simple fleshy fruit. From top right: [[Cranberry|cranberries]], [[lingonberries]], [[blueberries]] red [[Huckleberry|huckleberries]]]]

These are fruits which you can buy in shops, and which are also acceptable as botanical fruits:
* [[berry fruits]]: [[redcurrant]], [[gooseberry]], [[cranberry]], [[blueberry]] Also, but not commonly known as berry fruits, are [[tomato]], [[avocado]],  [[banana]]
* [[false berries]]: [[blackberry]], [[strawberry]], [[raspberry]]: they are aggregate fruits (see below). The [[yew]] berry is not a fruit at all because the yew is a [[conifer]].<ref>Note: the seed in a yew "berry" is very poisonous.</ref>
* [[stone fruit]]s or drupes: [[plum]], [[cherry]], [[peach]], [[apricot]], [[Olive (fruit)|olive]]
* [[citrus|citrus fruits]], like [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[grapefruit]]s, and [[tangerine]]s
* [[aggregate fruit]]s: [[raspberry|raspberries]], [[blackberry|blackberries]]
* [[multiple fruit]]s: [[pineapple]]s, [[fig]]s

Many fruits come from [[tree]]s or [[shrub|bushes]]. For plants, fruits are a means of dispersal, usually by animals. When the fruit breaks apart, the seeds can go into the ground and begin to grow. Most fruits we eat contain a lot of [[water]] and natural [[sugar]]s, and many are high in [[Vitamin C]]. They have a large amount of [[dietary fibre]]. Fruits are usually low in [[protein]] and [[fat]] content, but avocados and some nuts are exceptions to this. Not only humans, but our closest living relatives ([[primates]]) are keen fruit-eaters. So are many other groups of [[herbivorous]] [[mammal]]s and many [[bird]]s.<ref>Lewis, Robert A. 2002. ''CRC dictionary of agricultural sciences''. CRC Press. ISBN 0-8493-2327-4</ref>

== Seedless fruits ==
Seedlessness is an important feature of some fruits of commerce. Commercial bananas, pineapple, and [[watermelon]]s are examples of seedless fruits. Some [[citrus]] fruits, especially oranges, satsumas, mandarin oranges, and [[grapefruit]] are valued for their seedlessness.

Seedless bananas and grapes are [[ploidy|triploids]], and seedlessness results from the abortion of the [[embryo]]nic plant which is produced by fertilisation. The method requires normal pollination and fertilisation.<ref>Spiegel-Roy P. Goldschmidt E.E. 1996. ''The biology of citrus''. Cambridge. ISBN 0-521-33321-0 p87–88</ref>

A '''farm''' is a piece of [[land]] used to grow [[crop]]s  and/or [[Animal husbandry|raise animal]]s.

People who grow these plants or raise these animals are called [[farmer]]s. This type of work is called farming. 

Land that is used to grow plants for food, or could be used to grow plants for food is called [[arable]] land. A life raising animals for food is called a [[pastoral]] life. 

Many farms are very large and can cause damage. in some places farms are many and small. 
There are many types of farming. Some people farm to eat the food they produce ([[subsistence agriculture]]). Other farms, including large ones, sell their [[Product (consumer goods)|product]]s to many people far away in [[urban area]]s (industrial farming).  Most subsistence farms are in poorer countries, while industrial farms are in richer countries.

==Names of Farms==
[[File:Tea plantation in India02.jpg|thumb|alt=Tea plantation|A [[tea]] plantation in [[India]]]]
* A farm that produces [[fruit]]s or [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]] is called an ''orchard''.
* A farm that produces [[grape]]s is called a ''vineyard''.
* A farm that raises and trains [[horse]]s is called a ''stable''.
* A farm that produces [[milk]] and [[dairy|dairy products]] is called a ''dairy farm''.
* If the animals are raised for [[meat]] it is a [[ranch]].
* A large farm that produces non-essential crops like [[tobacco]], [[coffee]], [[cotton]] or [[sugarcane]] is called a ''plantation''.

[[Category:Basic English 850 words]][[File:World map 2004 CIA large 1.7m whitespace removed.jpg|thumb|300px|A map of the Earth]] '''Geography''' is the study of the [[Earth]] and its features, its inhabitants, and its phenomena.<ref>{{cite web |title=Geography |work=The American Heritage Dictionary/ of the English Language, Fourth Edition |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/geography |accessdate=October 9, 2006 }}</ref> The word ''geography'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''gê'' ("Earth") and ''graphein'' ("to write, draw"). It means "to write and draw about the Earth". The word was first used by a scientist called [[Eratosthenes]] (276-194 B.C.).

Its features are things like [[continent]]s, [[sea]]s, [[river]]s and [[mountain]]s. Its inhabitants are all the people and [[animal]]s that live on it. Its phenomena are the things that happen like [[tide]]s, [[wind]]s, and [[earthquake]]s.

A person who is an expert in geography is a geographer. A geographer tries to understand the world and the things that are in it, how they started and how they have changed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Geography: The Mother of Sciences |url=http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081003084542/http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf |archivedate=3rd October 2008}}</ref>

Geography is divided into two main parts called physical geography and human geography. Physical geography studies the natural environment and human geography studies the human environment. The human environmental studies would include things such as the [[population]] in a country, how a country's [[economy]] is doing, and more. There is also environmental geography.

Geographers need to know a lot about [[map]]s because maps are very important for understanding geography. Geographers use maps a lot, and often make them. Making maps is called [[cartography]], and similarly, people who make maps are cartographers.

== Natural environment ==

[[Category:Ethics]]
[[Category:Basic English 850 words]]'''Grammar''' means the rules about how to speak and write in a language. The [[Ancient Greek]]s used to call it ''grammatikē tékhnē'', the [[craft]] of letters. It can have any of these meanings:
# The study of a [[language]]: how it works, and everything about it. This is ''background research on language''.
# The study of [[sentence]] structure. A set of rules and examples to show how the language should be used. This is a ''correct usage grammar'', as in a textbook or manual.
# The system which people learn as they grow up. This is the ''native-speaker's grammar''.<ref name="McA">McArthur, Tom (ed) 1992. ''The Oxford companion to the English language. Oxford University Press''.</ref><sup>p446</sup><ref name="Crystal">Crystal, David 1995. ''The Cambridge encyclopedia of the English language''. Cambridge University Press.</ref><sup>p453</sup>

When we speak, we use the native-person's grammar, or as near as we can. When we write, we try to write with correct grammar. So, speaking and writing a language each have their own style.

== Different languages ==
All languages have their own grammar. Most [[Europe]]an languages are rather similar, but some, such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], are very different from all European languages.

English makes few changes to its word endings ('[[suffix]]es'). In the [[Italic]] or 'Romance' languages (such as [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), word endings carry a lot of meaning. In English we have just a few: plurals and possessives (''John's'') are the most common. In our verbs we have dropped most endings except one: I love, you love, but ''she love'''s'''''. That final ''''s'''' is a remnant of [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]], which had more suffixes. Verbs do have endings which show changes in [[Grammatical tense|tense]]: walk'''ed''', walk'''ing'''.

[[Word order]] is the other big difference. Romance languages normally put adjectives after the nouns to which they refer. For example, in English, a person may say ''I like fast cars'', but in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], it is ''Me gustan los coches rápidos''. The order of the words has changed: if just the words, without the grammar, are translated into English, it would mean 'to me they please the cars fast'. This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order. In [[German language|German]], verbs often come near the end of sentences (as: ''Die Katze hat die Nahrung gegessen.''), whereas in English we usually put them between [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Object (grammar)|object]], as: ''the cat has eaten the food''.

== Changing language ==
Written grammar changes slowly but spoken grammar is more [[fluid]]. Sentences which English speakers find normal today, might have seemed strange 100 years ago. And they might not, because many of our favourite sayings come from the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the [[Bible]], and from [[Shakespeare]].

Some people use grammar that is different from other people when speaking. For example, people who use what is called [[General American English]] or [[Received Pronunciation|BBC English]] might say, ''I didn't do anything'', while someone who speaks what is called [[African American Vernacular English]] or AAVE might say, ''I didn't do nothing''. [[London]] [[working class]] version: ''I ain't done nuffink!'' These are called ''double negatives'', and are found almost entirely in spoken English, and seldom written.

These differences are called [[dialect]]s. The dialect a person uses is usually decided by where they live. Even though the dialects of English use different words or word order, they still have grammar rules. However, when writing in American English, grammar uses the rules of General American English. When people talk about using 'proper English', they usually mean using the grammar of general British English, as described in standard reference works.<ref name="Nash">Nash, Walter 1986. ''English usage: a guide to first principles''. Routledge & Kegan Paul, London. Contains a list of sources.</ref> The models for ''spoken'' English in Britain are often called [[Received Pronunciation]] or BBC English.

== Syntax ==
Grammar studies [[syntax]] as well as the different parts of language. These are called "parts of speech". They fit together according to rules and create [[sentence]]s. Sentences fit together and create [[paragraph]]s.

== Parts of speech ==
Grammar studies [[noun]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[verb]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, [[preposition]]s, [[conjunction]]s, [[sentence]]s, [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, [[interjection]]s.

=== Nouns ===
Nouns are 'thing' words like 'table and 'chair'. They are [[wikt:object|objects]], things you see in everyday life. Proper nouns are places, people's names, or other things like days of the week. The name 'James' is a proper noun, as is 'Wednesday' and 'London'. Nouns can also be [[abstract]] things, such as 'suffering' or 'happiness'.

=== Verbs ===
Verbs describe [[wikt:action|actions]] and [[wikt:state|states]]. Action: "John threw the ball". State: "I am worried". The basic verb form is called the [[infinitive]]. The infinitive for existence is "to be". A famous example is the speech of [[Hamlet]]: ''To be or not to be, that is the question''.

Variations of the infinitive create [[Verb#Tense|verb tenses]]. 
{{col-begin}}
{{col-3}}
:<big> [[Past tense]] = ''was''</big>
{{col-3}}
:<big>[[Present tense]] = ''is''</big>
{{col-3}}
:<big>[[Future tense]] = ''will/shall''</big>
{{col-end}}

=== Adjectives === 
Adjectives describe nouns. For example, the pretty in "pretty bicycle" says that the bicycle is pretty. In other words, the "pretty" is describing the bicycle. This can also happen with a place. For example, the tall in "that's a tall building" is describing the building.

[[Category:Grammar| ]][[File:Great Lakes 1.PNG|thumb|right|230px|The Great Lakes]]
[[File:Great Lakes from space.jpg|thumb|right|230px|View from space of the Great Lakes]]

The '''Great Lakes''' are five large [[lake]]s in east-central [[North America]]. They hold 21% of the world's [[Surface area|surface]] [[fresh water]].<ref name=EPA>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/basicinfo.html |title=Great Lakes – U.S. EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2011-02-19}} Note: by 'surface' is meant 'as measured by [[surface area]]'. Measured by [[volume]] it would no doubt be a lesser figure.</ref> 

The lakes are:
* [[Lake Superior]]
* [[Lake Michigan]]
* [[Lake Huron]]
* [[Lake Erie]]
* [[Lake Ontario]]

== Geography ==
[[Image:Great Lakes 2.PNG|thumb|right|230px|Great Lakes: system profile]]

Four of the Great Lakes are on the border between [[Canada]] and the [[United States|United States of America]]. The other, Lake Michigan, is completely inside the United States.

All together, by [[volume]], they are the largest group of [[fresh water]] lakes in the world. No one of the Lakes is larger than [[Lake Baikal]] ([[Russia]]) or [[Lake Tanganyika]] ([[East Africa]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biology.usgs.gov/luhna/chap6.html |title=LUHNA Chapter 6: Historical Landcover Changes in the Great Lakes Region |publisher=Biology.usgs.gov |date=2003-11-20 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Fereidoun|last=Ghassemi| year=2007|title=Inter-basin water transfer| publisher=Cambridge, Cambridge University
Press|isbn=0-52-186969-2 }}</ref>

The cities of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] (9.8 million people, on Lake Michigan), [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] (5.5 million, on Lake Ontario); [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] (5.3 million, on the Detroit river); [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] (3.9 million, on the [[St. Lawrence River]]), [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] (2.9 million, on Lake Eyrie) and [[Ottawa]] (1.2 million, Ontario, on the Ottawa River) are on the shores of the Great Lakes or their rivers.

Though the five lakes have separate basins, they form a single, connected body of freshwater. The lakes connect the east-central interior of North America to the Atlantic Ocean. Water flows from Lake Superior and Lake Michigan into Lake Huron; then through the [[Detroit River]] into Lake Erie; then through [[Niagara Falls]] into Lake Ontario; and then through the [[Saint Lawrence River]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Water also drains from the [[Chicago River]] on the south.<ref group="Note">The Chicago River originally flowed into Lake Michigan.  The flow was artificially reversed to protect the quality of Chicago's drinking water that comes from Lake Michigan.</ref>

Many rivers flow through a large [[watershed]] into the lakes. The lakes have about 35,000 islands. The Great Lakes region includes the five lakes and many thousands of smaller lakes, often called ''inland lakes''.

Lake Michigan and Lake Huron hit all-time record low levels in 2013.<ref>''[http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/lakes-michigan-huron-hit-record-low-level-dq8loc2-189903561.html ''Lakes Michigan, Huron hit record low water level''] Feb. 5, 2013</ref>

The unusual shape of the Great Lakes has created the possibility of large waves called [[seiche]]. If a [[storm]] causes a fast, strong increase in [[air pressure]] on one side of a lake, the water level on that side of the lake will drop and suddenly push up the water level on the opposite side of the lake.  A 10 foot tall wave in Chicago caused several deaths in 1954.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1129.html|title=Seiches|accessdate=November 24, 2011}}</ref>

== Ecological threats ==
The Great Lakes are home to a variety of species of fish and other organisms. In recent years, [[overfishing]] caused a decline in lake [[trout]]. The drop in lake trout increased the [[alewife]] population. In response, the government introduced [[salmon]] as a predator to decrease the alewife population. This program was so successful that the salmon population rose rapidly, and the states surrounding Lake Michigan promoted 'salmon snagging'. This has been made illegal in all of the Great Lakes states except for a limited season in Illinois. Lake Michigan is now being stocked with several species of fish. However, several invader species such as [[lamprey]]s, [[round goby]], and [[zebra mussel]]s threaten the native fish populations.

=== Invasive species ===
Accidentally [[Invasive species|introduced species]] are a big problem. Since the 19th century about 160 species have invaded the Great Lakes ecosystem, causing severe economic and ecological impacts.<ref name="ISEA">{{cite web |url=http://www.greatlakeseducation.org/about_isea/?id=204 |title=Our threatened Great Lakes |accessdate=2007-11-30 |publisher=Inland Seas Education Association}}</ref> According to the Inland Seas Education Association, they deprive fish of food, cause blooms of toxic [[algae]], and [[foul]] boats, [[spawn]]ing areas and drinking water intakes. On average a new invasive species enters the Great Lakes every eight months.<ref name="ISEA" />

Two important infestations in the Great Lakes are the [[zebra mussel]],  first discovered in 1988, and the [[quagga mussel]] in 1989.{{fact|date=January 2012}} These [[mollusc]]s are efficient filter feeders. They compete with native [[mussel]]s, and also reduce available food and spawning grounds for fish.  

Also, the mussels hurt utility and manufacturing industries by clogging or blocking pipes. The [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] estimates that the economic impact of the zebra mussel will be about $5&nbsp;billion over the next decade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glc.org/ans/ |title=Great Lakes aquatic nuisance species |accessdate=2007-11-30 |publisher=Great Lakes Commission |date=2007-03-27}}</ref> Because the quagga mussel is good at filtering [[plankton]] from the lake water, sunlight reaches deeper into the lake. This increases the growth of algae.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/environment/july-dec11/mussels_11-23.html#transcript|title=Tiny mussels invade Great Lakes, threaten fishing industry|date=November 23, 2011|accessdate=November 23, 2011|work=PBS Newshour}}</ref>

=== Pollution ===
Chemicals from industrial plants run off the land into rivers and arrive in the lakes. Some of these chemicals are highly [[toxic]], such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. [[Contaminated]] water from [[sewer]] overflows also reaches the lakes, and beaches get closed because of the threat of [[pathogen]]ic [[bacteria]].<ref name=ISEA/>

[[The Good Dinosaur|The]] '''GNU Free Documentation License''' (GFDL) is a [[copyleft]] [[license]] for [[open content]]. It was made up by the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) for the [[GNU]] project. It was initially created for use with software documentation, but can be applied to other types of works as well, such as [[Wikipedia]]. 

As a [[copyright]] license, the GFDL is a type of [[contract]] between the creator of a copyrightable work (such as a [[book]], an [[encyclopedia]] article, a [[painting]], or a piece of [[music]]) and anyone else who might want to use it. The GFDL is considered "copyleft" because the license is meant to make it easier to use and re-use the copyrighted work, not to restrict its use. 

If a copyrightable work is released under the GFDL, the creator of the work is saying that anyone else may reproduce, distribute, or modify the work, as long as they follow a set of requirements specified in the GFDL. Among the requirements of the GFDL are that any new work created from the original work is also licensed under the GFDL—that is, once something is licensed as GFDL, it will always stay licensed as GFDL, and anything which uses it also is licensed as GFDL. (Because the license "reproduces" and stays with the work, this is sometimes called a "[[virus|viral]]" license.)

The GFDL also says that in order to distribute or modify a work licensed with the GFDL, the re-user must give credit to any previous authors of the work, and include a list of changes they made to the work. 

Finally, any work licensed with the GFDL must contain, somewhere, the entire text of the license. This provision has been criticized, because it is not always easy to include an entire, long license with a copyrighted work. In a book, for example, it is easy to include one extra page with the license, but if the work is something like a song, or a photograph, it is not easy. 

The GFDL has other requirements that are more complicated. For example, if part of the work is labeled as an "invariant section," it cannot ever be removed or changed by someone using the work ("invariant" means "does not change"). 

Works licensed under the GFDL may be included in with non-GFDL-licensed works only if it is clear which parts of the work are licensed as the GFDL. For example, in a book of poetry it would be easy to label some poems as licensed under the GFDL and some not licensed under it. But it would not be easy to label if part of a song was licensed as GFDL and the rest was not, so this would not be allowed. 

Any use of GFDL material which violates the terms of the GFDL is potentially [[copyright infringement]].

A number of online projects use the GFDL. An online project to license its content under the GFDL is [[Wikipedia]].<ref>[[Wikipedia:Copyrights]]</ref>

The GFDL has been criticized by many people who wish that it made it even easier for content to be re-used. Among the criticisms are that it is very hard to combine GFDL material with other copyleft licenses, that it is not always clear and easy to understand, and that some of its requirements, such as the "invariant sections", are not free at all.

[[File:Edo-Kiriko.JPG|thumb|right|250px| Edo-Kiriko, a traditional cut glass craft in Asakusa, [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. The glass has two layers, a coloured layer outside a clear layer]]

'''Glass''' is a [[wikt:hard|hard]] [[material]] that can be made in many [[shape]]s. It is usually [[transparency|transparent]], but it can also be made in [[colour]]s. Glass is mainly made of [[silica]] ([[sand]] is an example). 

Glass used to make [[window]]s and [[bottle]]s is made of  a specific type called soda-lime glass, composed of about 75% [[silicon dioxide]] (SiO<sub>2</sub>), [[sodium oxide]] (Na<sub>2</sub>O) from [[sodium carbonate]] (Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), [[Calcium oxide|calcium oxide, also called lime]] (CaO), and several minor additives. 

By changing the proportions, and adding different ingredients, many kinds of glass can be made. Coloured glass is made by adding small amounts of metal oxides. For example, a blue colour is given by tiny amounts of [[cobalt oxide]].

Crystal glass is made by adding [[lead oxide|lead]] and [[zinc oxide]]s. It is not actually a crystal, because all glass is a non-[[crystalline]] solid. Crystal glass is called cut glass if it has been cut by hand:
:" 'Cut glass' is glass that has been decorated entirely by hand by use of rotating wheels. Cuts are made in an otherwise completely smooth surface of the glass by workers holding and moving the piece against various sized metal or stone wheels".<ref>American Cut Glass Association. [http://www.cutglass.org/AboutCutGlass.htm]</ref>

Because glass is used to make [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], the word "glasses" means [[eyeglasses]].

The [[myth]] that glass is actually a liquid comes from the fact that old windows in houses and churches (200–300 years old) are sometimes a little out of shape: thicker at the bottom than the top.  This is actually due to the process of glass making in the past which led to the glass pane being thicker at one edge than the other.  It was sensible to install the windows with the thick edge at the bottom.  Sometimes a window can be found with the thick edge at the top of the window.

Glass can be [[Recycling|recycled]] over and over. Glass bottles and jars can easily be recycled to make new glass bottles and jars or used in industry as aggregate (building material) or sand.

[[File:Brahma Halebid.jpg|thumb|[[Brahma]] is the creator god in [[Hinduism]]. Brahma, [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]] are the most important Hindu gods. This image shows Brahma on a [[temple]] wall.]] 

'''God''' is the maker of the earth and of everything, according to certain [[religion]]s and [[List of mythologies|mythologies]]. [[Hinduism]] says there is more than one god. [[Theist]]s believe that God created everything that [[wikt:exist|exist]]s.<ref name="Swinburne">{{citation |last=Swinburne |first=R.G. |chapter=God |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |quote=...most philosophical theologians... have generally regarded him as a personal being, bodiless, omnipresent, creator and sustainer of any universe there may be, perfectly free, omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good, and a source of moral obligation; who exists eternally and necessarily...}}.</ref> In most religions, God is believed to be immortal (cannot die), and to have powers to control nature far beyond the powers of humans.

The belief that there is at least one god is usually called [[theism]]. People who reject belief that any deities exist are called [[atheism|atheists]]. [[Agnosticism|Agnostics]] think we cannot know for sure whether any deities exist, but still might (or might not) believe at least one deity exists. People who believe in a god but not in religion are called ''deists''. People who believe that the definition of "''God''" should be defined before taking a theological position are [[Ignosticism|ignostic]].

In some religions there are many [[Deity|gods]]. This is called [[polytheism]]. In other religions, there is only one, which is called [[monotheism]]. In polytheism the word "gods" is usually written in lowercase letters. ''God'' is usually written with an uppercase letter when only one god is believed to exist. Some polytheists also use uppercase when talking about their most important god.

== Does God exist? ==
Many people have asked themselves if God exists. Philosophers, theologians and others have tried to prove that it exists, others have tried to show that it does not exist. In [[Philosophy|philosophical]] terminology, such arguments are about the [[epistemology]] of the [[ontology]] of God. The debate exists mainly in philosophy since science does not address whether or not [[supernatural]] things exist.

There are many philosophical issues with the existence of God. Some definitions of God are not specific.<ref>http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2002/entries/omnipotence/</ref> Arguments for the existence of God typically include [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], [[empiricism|empirical]], [[inductive reasoning|inductive]], and subjective types. Some theories are built around holes in [[evolution|evolutionary theory]], as well as order and complexity in the [[world]]. Arguments against the existence of God typically include empirical, [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and inductive arguments. Conclusions sometimes include: "God does not exist" ([[atheism|strong atheism]]); "God almost certainly does not exist"<ref name="Dawkins">{{cite web 
| last=Dawkins

| accessdate=2007-01-10
| publisher=The Huffington Post}}</ref> (''de facto'' [[atheism]]); "no one knows whether God exists" ([[agnosticism]]); "God exists, but this cannot be proven or disproven" ([[deism]] or [[theism]]); and "God exists and this can be proven" (theism). There are many variations on these positions, and sometimes different names for some of them. For example, the position "God exists and this can be proven" is sometimes called "gnostic theism" or "strong theism".

==Names==
There are different names for God in different religions. Some examples are [[Allah]] in Islam, [[Yahweh]] or [[Elohim]] in Judaism, [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|Baha]] in [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Waheguru]] in Sikhism, and [[Ahura Mazda]] in Zoroastrianism.

== Believing in God ==
[[File:Europe belief in god.svg|thumb|250px|The percentage of people in European countries who said in 2005 that they "believe there is a God". Countries with [[Eastern Orthodox]] (i.e.: [[Greece]], [[Romania]], etc.) or [[Muslim]] (Turkey) majorities tend to poll highest.]]
In the year  2000, approximately 53% of the world's population were part of one of the three main Abrahamic religions (33% Christian, 20% Islam,  less than 1% Judaism), 6% with Buddhism, 13% with Hinduism, 6% with [[Chinese folk religion|traditional Chinese religion]], 7% with various other religions, and less than 15% as non-religious. Most of these religious beliefs involve God or gods.<ref>National Geographic Family Reference Atlas of the World p. 49</ref>

== God in the Abrahamic religions ==
[[Abrahamic religions]] are very popular monotheistic ones. Well-known Abrahamic religions include [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]].  [[Monotheistic]] means the people in these religions believe there is only one God.  The name of God is usually not allowed to be said in [[Judaism]], but some Jews today call him [[YHWH]] (Yahweh) or Jehovah. [[Muslim]]s say the word [[Allah]], which is the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for "The God." 

Believers in the Abrahamic religions (except Islamic believers) believe that God has created [[human beings]] in his [[image]] or [[wikt:likeness|likeness]], but this idea is rarely taken literally. The idea of an old man with a beard has been used in art since the [[Renaissance]].

=== God in Christianity ===
{{main|God in Christianity}}
The [[Christian]] [[Bible]] talks about God in different ways. Christians say that the [[Old Testament]] talks about "God the Father". The [[New Testament]] is about [[Jesus]], or "God the Son". Many Christians also believe that Jesus was God's [[incarnation]] on earth.  Christians consider the [[Holy Spirit]] to be God as well.

In the [[New Testament]], there are three beings who are said to be God in different forms: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (also known as the Holy Ghost). This is called the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]] by most people who believe in it. Although the word "Trinity" is not in the Bible, the word used for God in chapter one of [[Genesis]] is [[plural]], and the words ' in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit' are used in the [[New Testament]], (e.g. [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28:19) Another word that most Christians believe means the same thing as "Trinity" is Godhead. 

Some believe that Jesus was just a man that talked about God. Members of the [[Unitarian Church]] have this beliefs.

Christians believe that [[incarnation|God turned into a man]] named [[Jesus]], and came to Earth to save everyone from [[sin]]. When Jesus prayed and talked to God, he called him "Father," and taught others to do the same.

== God in Eastern religions ==
In [[Hinduism]], there is only one God, named [[Brahman]], but Brahman is said to have taken on many different [[incarnation]]s. Some of these are [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Buddha]], [[Shiva]], [[Kali]], [[Parvati]], and [[Durga]]. To many outsiders, the worship of God's different incarnations is considered to be the worship of many gods. However, it is really only the worship of one God in different ways.

Some Hindus also believe that the spirit of God lives in everyone. This idea is called [[Advaita Vedanta]], which is the Hindu term for [[Monism]].

Religions like [[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]] involve the worship of many gods, or sometimes no gods at all.

== God in Western philosophy ==
Philosophers can talk about God or god; sometimes they talk about a specific god, but other times they are just talking about the idea of god.

One of the earliest Western philosophers to write about God in a monotheistic way was the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Aristotle]], who describes god as the Supreme Cause. Aristotle saw God as a being that makes everything happen, but is not influenced by anything else.

There are also some philosophical problems with God. One of them is called [[God paradox]]. It is a question about whether (an omnipotent) God can make a mountain that is so heavy he cannot lift it.

[[Category:Gods and goddesses]][[File:Suushi Yurei.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Onryo|Yūrei]] (Japanese ghost) from the [[Hyakkai Zukan]], ca. 1737]]
A '''ghost''' is considered to be the [[spirit]] of a [[Human death|dead]] person. [[Scientist]]s say that there are no [[reality|real]] ghosts,<ref>Shane McCorristine ''Spectres of the Self: Thinking About Ghosts and Ghost-Seeing in England,1750-1920'' 2010, pp. 44-56</ref><ref>Ken Gelder ''The horror reader'' 2000, pp. 43-44</ref> but many people believe that there are.

There are many [[wikt:story|stories]] about ghosts in [[book]]s and [[movie]]s. Sometimes the ghost is the spirit of a person who was killed or who died. The ghost may stay on [[Earth]] because he or she has unfinished problems or is still trying to say good bye to loved ones. Sometimes ghosts are said to live in a particular [[wikt:locality|locality]], for example an abandoned [[house]].

Sometimes the ghosts in these stories exist because of some problem the person had during life or to say good bye to loved ones, that was not solved before he or she died. The ghost stays on the Earth trying to fix the problem. If the problem is fixed, the ghost can leave the Earth. Many people say they have seen or heard ghosts. People who try to talk to ghosts as their job are called [[Medium (spirituality)|mediums]].

There can be bad ghosts and there can also be good ones. There have never been any ghosts that have actually hurt or killed people, although people tell stories about it.

Many people believe they have seen ghosts. Others believe they have felt ghosts near them. Often the ghost is said to appear as a feeling of [[cold]] and a [[light]] or a misty [[cloud]], but sometimes people say they have seen ghosts that look more like people. Sometimes ghosts are said to come in [[human]] form. Some ghosts might cause fear in the person who sees them, by being seen suddenly. Some ghosts are said to be friendly and help people who have problems.

Ghosts are said to form right after they die, or even [[century|centuries]] later. Many people make up stories or urban [[legend]]s. Many try to prove the existence of these paranormal [[creature]]s with special [[technology]] such as heat [[sensor]]s. They also make TV shows dedicated to proving the existence of ghosts. They often investigate cases where a person has seen one or visit a place of sighting.

'''Green''' is a [[color]].  It is one of the colors of the [[rainbow]]. Green is between the [[yellow]] and [[blue]] colors in a rainbow. Green [[paint]] can be made by mixing yellow paint and blue paint together. 

Green light, like all [[light]], is [[quanta]]—composed of [[photon]]s.  The [[wavelength]] of green light is about 550 [[nanometer]]s (one-billionth of a [[meter]]).

Most [[leaf|leaves]] of growing [[plant]]s, such as [[tree]]s and [[shrub|bush]]es, are green. This is because there is a [[chemical]] in [[leaf|leaves]], called [[chlorophyll]], which is colored green.

[[Category:Colors]]'''God's eye view''' is a name for a [[point of view]] where the speaker or writer assumes they have [[knowledge]] only [[God]] would have.  It appears several ways:

*In [[religion]], when an [[institution]] claims to speak for a [[divine being]].

*In [[writing]], when an [[author]] leaves the [[point of view]] of the [[main actor]] to start writing about things they could not know if the story were in real life.

*In [[science]], when a [[scientist]] ignores the way a [[subject-object problem]] affects [[statistics]] or an [[observer effect]] affects [[experiment]].

*In [[medicine]] when the [[Medical doctor|doctor]] makes a claim that [[The Gaze]] he uses on a patient, actually sees the problem, rather than making a guess at a problem.

*In [[ethics]] when a statement is made about who or what is right, without an honest attempt to make the [[wikt:process|process]] of deciding this consider all points of view.

A special case of the last is in a [[wiki]] with a [[GodKing]].  Often this person can get others to believe what they say about what is right, without making any special effort to be fair to other views.

Many people think [[Rene Descartes]] took a God's eye view when he said [[cogito ergo sum]].  [[George Berkeley]] argued that [[optics]] from [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Johannes Kepler]] also had this problem.

[[File:Googleplex-SignIn.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A man signing in at Google's main office, Googleplex.]]
'''Google Inc.''' is an American [[multinational corporation]] that runs one of the largest [[search engine]]s on the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW). Every day 200 million (200,000,000) people use it. Google's main office ("Googleplex") is in [[Mountain View, California]], [[United States]].

P[[picture|ictures]], [[Usenet]] newsgroups, [[news]], and things to [[Online shopping|buy online]] and other things are googleabl. By June [[2004]], Google had 4.28 billion [[web page]]s on its database, 880 million (880,000,000) pictures and 845 million (845,000,000) Usenet messages — six billion things. 

"To [[wikt:google|google]]," as an action word ([[verb]]) means "to search for something on Google". Because Google has an Alexa rank of 1 (more than half of people on the web use it) it has been used to mean "to search the web". Google dislikes this use since the name of the company is a [[trademark]].{{fact|date=August 2016}}
As a [[public company]], Google Inc. [[Stock trading|trades]] on the [[NASDAQ]] under the tickers [http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/goog GOOG] and [http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/googl GOOGL].

In August 2015, Google announced it was being restructured under a new [[holding company]] called [[Alphabet Inc.|Alphabet Inc, a company founded by the same people who founded Google itself.]]

== History ==
Google was started in early 1996 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two students at [[Stanford University]], USA. It used to be called Backrub. they made it into a company, Google Inc., on [[September 7]], [[1998]] at a friend's garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], [[California]]. In February [[1999]], the company moved to 165 University Ave., [[Palo Alto, California]].  it moved to another place called the Googleplex.

In September 2001, Google's rating system (PageRank, for saying which information is more helpful) got a U.S. [[Patent]]. The patent was to Stanford University, with Lawrence (Larry) Page as the [[inventor]] (the person who first had the idea).

Google makes a percentage of its money through [[America Online]] and InterActiveCorp. It has a special group known as the Partner Solutions Organization (PSO) which helps make [[contract]]s, helps making accounts better, and gives engineering help.

==How Google makes money==
Google makes money by [[advertising]]. People or companies who want people to buy their product, service, or ideas give Google money, and Google shows an advertisement to people Google thinks will click on the advertisement. Google only gets money when people click on the link, so it tries to know as much about people as possible to only show the advertisement to the "right people". It does this with Google Analytics, which sends data back to Google whenever someone visits a web site. From this and other data, Google makes a profile about the person, which it then uses to figure out which advertisements to show.

== The name "Google" ==
The name "Google" is a misspelling of the word ''[[googol]]''.<ref>Koller, David. "[http://graphics.stanford.edu/~dk/google_name_origin.html Origin of the name, "Google."] ''[[Stanford University]].'' January, 2004.</ref><ref name=hiw >{{citation|title=Google revolution|publisher=Imagine Publishing|newspaper=How it Works|pages=40-43|issue=37|date=2012-08-09}}</ref> [[Milton Sirotta]], nephew of U.S. mathematician [[Edward Kasner]], made this word in 1938, for the number 1 followed by one hundred zeroes (<math>10^{100}</math>). It is said that the word "googol" was chosen as a name for this number because it sounded like baby talk.{{fact|date=August 2016}}
 Google uses this word because the company wants to make lots of stuff on the Web easy to find and use. Andy Bechtolsheim thought of the name. 

The name for Google's main office, the "Googleplex," is a play on a different, even bigger number, the "[[googolplex]]", which is 1 followed by one googol of zeroes.

[[Category:Imperial units]]
[[Category:Units of volume]]A '''government''' is a group of people that have the [[Influence|power]] to rule in a [[territory]], according to the [[law]]. This territory may be a [[country]], a [[state]] or [[province]] within a country, or a region. 
 
*Governments make [[law]]s, rules, and regulations, collect [[tax]]es and print [[money]]. 
*Governments have systems of [[:wikt:justice|justice]] that list the acts or activities that are against the law and describe the punishments for breaking the law. 
*Governments have a [[police]] force to make sure people follow the laws. 
*Governments have [[diplomacy|diplomats]] who communicate with the governments of other [[country|countries]] by having meetings. Diplomats try to solve problems or disagreements between two countries, which can help countries to avoid war, make commercial agreements, and exchange cultural or social experiences and [[knowledge]]. 
*Governments have a [[military]] force such as an [[army]] that protects the country if other countries attack or which can be used to attack and invade other countries. 
*The [[leader]] of a government and his or her [[advisor]]s are called the [[administration]]. 

== Types of governments ==
=== Democracy ===
The most common type of government in the Western world is called [[democracy]]. In democracies, people in a country can vote during elections for representatives or political parties that they prefer. The people in democracies can elect representatives who will sit on [[legislature]]s such as the [[Parliament]] or [[Congress]]. [[political party|Political parties]] are organizations of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed. Different political parties have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems. Democracy is the government of the people, by the people and for the people. 

However, many countries have forms of democracy which limit freedom of choice by the voters. One of the most common ways is to limit which parties who can for parliament, or limit the parties access to mass media such as television. Another way is to rig the voting system by removing votes from opposition voters and substituting votes for the party in power. Few countries are textbook democracies, and the differences between them has been much studied.<ref>Hoppe, Hans-Hermann. 2001. ''Democracy: the god that failed''. Rutgers, N.J: Transaction. [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe4.html]</ref><ref> Benoist, Alain de 2011. ''The problem of democracy''. Arktos Media. </ref><ref>Graham, Gordon 2002. ''The case against the democratic state: an essay in cultural criticism''. Imprint Academic.</ref>

=== Monarchy ===
A [[monarchy]] is a government ruled by a king or a queen who inherits their position from their family, which is often called the "royal family." There are two types of monarchies: absolute monarchies and constitutional monarchies. In an absolute monarchy, the ruler has no limits on their wishes or powers. In a [[constitutional monarchy]] a ruler's powers are limited by a document called a [[constitution]].

=== Aristocracy ===
An [[aristocracy]] is a government by the "best" people. A person who rules in an aristocracy is an aristocrat. Aristocracy is different from nobility, in that nobility means that one bloodline would rule, an aristocracy would mean that a few or many bloodlines would rule, or that rulers be chosen in a different manner.

=== Dictatorship ===
Under a [[dictatorship]], the government is run by one person who has all the power over the people in a country. Originally, the [[Roman Republic]] made dictators to lead during time of war. The Roman dictators (and Greek [[tyrant]]s) were not always bad. The Roman dictators only held power for a small time. In modern times, a dictator's rule is not stopped by any laws, constitutions, or other social and political institutions. After World War II, many governments in Latin America, Asia, and Africa were ruled by dictators. Examples of dictators include [[Josef Stalin]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Muammar al-Qaddafi]], and [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]].

=== Oligarchy ===
An [[oligarchy]] is a government ruled by a small group of powerful people. These people may spread power equally or not equally. An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things. An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or passed down from father to son. An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler, but several powerful people. Some past examples of oligarchy are the former [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] and [[Apartheid]] [[South Africa]]. A fictional example is the [[dystopia]]n society of ''Oceania'' in the book [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]. Some critics of [[representative democracy]] think of the [[United States]] as an oligarchy. This view is shared by [[anarchism|anarchists]].

== The history and the theory of government ==

The simplest idea of government is those who [[rule]] over [[wikt:people|people]] and [[land]]. This may be as small as a community with some sort of board that looks after the goings on of those who live within it or something a little larger like a [[village]] or as big as a [[continent]] (like [[Australia]] and [[India]]). 

Those people who rule the land can allow others to [[own]] it. It is a [[wikt:deed|deed]] by government that gives this right in the way that [[law]]s describe. Some think they have the right to hold land without government permission. This view is called [[libertarianism]]. Others think they can do so together as a group with others if they live in [[peace]], without government. This view is called [[anarchism]]. 

Almost every place on [[Earth]] is connected to one and only one government. Places without government are where people follow traditions instead of government rules, small [[border dispute]]d areas and the continent of Antarctica, because almost no people live there. For every other place on Earth there is a government that claims 'sovereign control' over it. The word "sovereign" is old and means "control by a [[King]]" ([[sovereign]]). Governments of [[village]]s, [[city|cities]], [[county|counties]] and other [[community|communities]] are also subordinate to the government of the state or province where they exist, and then to that of the [[country]].

It is from Kings and [[feudalism]] that modern governments and [[nation state]]s came. The [[Capital (city)|capital]] of a country, for instance, is where the King kept his [[asset]]s. From this we get the modern idea of [[capital (economics)|capital]] in [[economics]]. A government is said to [[wikt:regulation|regulate]] [[trade]] as well as to rule over land.

Governments also control people and decide things about what [[morality]] to accept or [[punish]]. In very many countries, there are strict rules about [[sexual intercourse]] and [[drug]]s that are part of [[law]] and offenders are punished for disobeying them.

[[Tax]] is how government is paid for in most countries. People who [[buy]], [[sales|sell]], [[import]], [[invest]], own a house or land, or earn money are made to pay some of the [[money]] to a government.

There are many theories of how to organize government better. These are called theories of [[civics]]. Because government is run by people who can be greedy, many people think [[leader]]s must be [[elect]]ed by some kind of [[democracy]]. That way, if government does not act nice, they can be replaced in the next [[election]]. Still many countries' governments are not a [[democracy]] but other forms in which only a few people have power.

There are many theories of how to run a government better, and keep people from hurting each other. These theories are part of [[politics]]. No matter how a government is chosen, it must do politics to keep [[Influence|power]].

[[Gravity]] holds galaxies together against the general [[expansion of the universe]].<ref name=cox1 /> In effect, the expansion of the universe takes place between groups of galaxies, not inside those groups. This is because the mass of a galaxy holds the galaxy together, and the same applies to the groups of galaxies, such as our [[Local Group]]. The gravitation is produced by the matter and energy in a galaxy or group of galaxies. Everything in a galaxy moves around a [[centre of mass]], which is also an effect of gravity.  

There are various types of galaxies: [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical]], [[Spiral galaxy|spiral]] and [[lenticular galaxy|lenticular]] galaxies, which can all be with or without bars. Then there are [[Irregular galaxy|irregular]] galaxies. All galaxies exist inside the [[universe]].

Retrieved 2010-05-06]</ref> (10<sup>14</sup>) stars, all orbiting the galaxy's [[center of mass]]. Galaxies may contain many multiple star systems, [[star cluster]]s, and various [[interstellar cloud]]s. The [[Sun]] is one of the stars in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy; the [[Solar System]] includes the Earth and all the other objects that orbit the Sun.

Star clusters are not galaxies, they are inside galaxies. [[Globular clusters]] are spherical tightly knit balls of stars which are part of the outer [[halo]] of the Milky Way. One of the largest (and oldest) known star clusters, [[Messier 15]], has several million stars, packed closely together, with a [[black hole]] at its centre. The stars are too closely packed to get an accurate count, but it certainly has more stars than some of the smaller galaxies. 

Within [[galaxy cluster]]s, galaxies move relative to other galaxies. They can and do collide. When this happens, the stars generally move past each other, but gas clouds and dust interact, and can form a burst of new stars. Gravity pulls both galaxies into somewhat new shapes, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.

Many galaxies also continue to form new generations of stars. The Milky Way, and all spiral shaped galaxies like it (see above image of NGC 2997), produce new stars at a rate of one or two stars per year. These stars are formed in the vast interstellar clouds that account for about 1% to 10% of the mass of these galaxies. Globular star clusters, on the other hand, are not currently forming stars because this activity happened billions of years ago and then stopped once all of the gas and dust clouds were used up. 

In the [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[literature]], the word 'Galaxy' with a capital ''G'' is used for our galaxy, the [[Milky Way]]. The billions of other galaxies are just written as 'galaxy' with a lowercase ''g''. The term ''Milky Way'' first came out in the English language in a poem by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]].

[[Category:Galaxies| ]]'''Geometry''' is a kind of [[mathematics]] that studies the [[size]], [[shape]]s, and positions of things. There are [[wikt:flat|flat]] ([[2D]]) shapes and solid ([[3D]]) shapes in geometry.
[[square (geometry)|Squares]], [[circle]]s and [[triangle]]s are some of the simplest shapes in flat geometry. [[Cube]]s, [[cylinder]]s, [[cone]]s and [[sphere]]s are simple shapes in solid geometry.

== Uses ==
Geometry can be used to [[measure]] the [[area]] and [[perimeter]] of a flat shape. It can also be used to measure a [[solid]] shape's [[volume]] and [[surface area]].

Geometry can be used to calculate the size and shape of many things. For example, geometry can help people find: 
* the surface area of a [[house]], so they can buy the right amount of [[paint]] 
* the [[volume]] of a [[box]], to see if it is big enough to hold a [[litre|liter]] of [[food]]
* the area of a [[farm]], so it can be divided into equal parts
* the [[distance]] around the [[edge]] of a [[pond]], to know how much [[fence|fencing]] to [[buy]].

== Origins ==
Geometry began as the art of [[measure|measuring]] the shape of [[land]] so that it could be shared fairly between people. The word "geometry" means "to measure the land". It has grown from this to become one of the most important parts of mathematics. The [[ancient Greece|Greek]] [[mathematician]] [[Euclid]] wrote the first book about geometry. Geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics.

== Examples ==
Geometry starts with a few simple ideas that are thought to be true, called axioms. Such as:

*A '''[[point (geometry)|point]]''' is shown on [[paper]] by [[touch]]ing it with a [[pencil]] or [[pen]], without making any [[sideways]] movement. We know where the point is, but it has no [[size]].

*A '''[[straight]] [[line]]''' is the [[short]]est [[distance]] between two points. For example, Sophie pulls a piece of [[wikt:string|string]] from one point to another point. A straight line between the two points will follow the [[wikt:path|path]] of the tight string.

*A '''[[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]''' is a flat [[surface]] that does not [[wikt:stop|stop]] in any [[direction]]. For example imagine a wall that extends in all directions infinitely.

[[Category:Geometry|*]][[File:6n-graf.svg|thumb|300px|right|An undirected graph.]]

'''Graph theory''' is a field of [[math]]ematics about graphs. A [[graph]] is an [[abstract]] representation of: A number of [[point (geometry)|point]]s are connected by [[line]]s. Each point is usually called a ''vertex'' (more than one are called ''vertices''), and the lines are called ''edges''.  Graphs are a tool for modelling relationships. They are used to find answers to a number of problems.

Some of these questions are:
* What is the best way for a [[mailman]] to get to all of the [[house]]s in the area in the least amount of [[time]]? The points could represent [[street]] corners and lines could represent the houses along the street. (see [[Chinese postman problem]])

* A salesman has to visit different customers, but wants to keep the distance traveled as small as possible. The problem is to find a way so they can do it. This problem is known as [[Travelling Salesman Problem]] (and often abbreviated ''TSP''). It is among the hardest problems to solve. If a commonly believed [[conjecture]] is true (described as '''P''' ≠ '''NP'''), then an exact solution requires one to try all possible routes to find which is shortest.

* How many colors would be needed to color a map, if countries sharing a border are colored differently? The points could represent the different areas and the lines could represent that two areas are neighboring. (look at the [[Four color theorem]])

* Can a sketch be drawn in one closed line? The lines of the drawing are the lines of the graph and when two or more lines collide, there is a point in the graph. The task is now to find a way through the graph using each line one time. (look at [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]])

== Different kinds of Graphs ==
[[File:Directed.svg|125px|thumb|A directed graph.]]
*Graph theory has many aspects. Graphs can be directed or undirected. An example of a directed graph would be the system of roads in a city. Some streets in the city are one way streets. This means, that on those parts there is only one direction to follow.
*Graphs can be weighted. An example would be a road network, with distances, or with [[toll]]s (for roads).
*The nodes (the circles in the schematic) of a graph are called [[vertex|vertices]]. The lines connecting the nodes are called [[edge]]s. There can be no line between two nodes, there can be one line, or there can be multiple lines.

[[File:Konigsberg bridges.png|thumb|200px|The Königsberg Bridge problem, on a city map]]
[[File:Königsberg_graph.svg|thumb|200px|The same problem, but using a graph]]

[[Leonhard Euler]] used to live in a city that was called ''Königberg'' for some time. (The city has been called [[Kaliningrad]] since 1946). The city is situated on the river Pregel. There is an island in the river, and there are a number of bridges across the river. Euler loved to go for walks, so he asked himself, whether it was possible to do a walk, use each of the bridges once, and come back to the point where he started. In 1736, he published a scientific article where he showed that this was not possible. Today, this problem is known as the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]]. The article is seen as the first paper in the history of graph theory.<ref name="Biggs">{{cite book|author=Biggs, N.; Lloyd, E. and Wilson, R.|title=Graph Theory, 1736-1936|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1986}}</ref>  

This article, as well as the one written by [[Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]] on the ''[[Knight's tour|knight problem]],'' carried on with the ''analysis situs'' initiated by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Euler's formula was about the number of edges, vertices, and faces of a [[convex]] [[polyhedron]] was studied and generalized by [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]<ref name="Cauchy">{{cite journal|author=Cauchy, A.L.|year=1813|title=Recherche sur les polyèdres - premier mémoire|journal=Journal de l'[[École Polytechnique]]|volume= 9 (Cahier 16)|pages=66–86}}</ref> and [[Simon Antoine Jean L'Huillier|L'Huillier]],<ref name="Lhuillier">{{cite journal|author=L'Huillier, S.-A.-J.|title=Mémoire sur la polyèdrométrie|journal=Annales de Mathématiques|volume=3|year=1861|pages=169–189}}</ref> and is at the origin of [[topology]].

Over a century after Euler, [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] studied a special class of graphs, called the ''[[tree (graph theory)|trees]]. A tree is a graph where there is only one path between two vertices.  Cayley tried to solve a problem from [[differential calculus]]. His solution influenced the development of theoretical [[chemistry]]. The technique he used mainly focused on listing all graphs which had certain properties. Today, this is called ''Enumerative graph theory''. It developed from Cayleys results, a scientific publication done by  [[George Pólya|Pólya]] between 1935 and 1937 and the generalization of these by [[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn|De Bruijn]] in 1959. Cayley linked his results on trees with the contemporary studies of chemical composition.<ref name="Cayley1">{{cite journal|author=Cayley, A.|year=1875|journal=Berichte der deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft|title=Ueber die Analytischen Figuren, welche in der Mathematik Bäume genannt werden und ihre Anwendung auf die Theorie chemischer Verbindungen|volume=8|pages=1056–1059|doi=10.1002/cber.18750080252}}</ref>

The fusion of the ideas coming from mathematics with those coming from chemistry is at the origin of a part of the standard terminology of graph theory. In particular, the term "graph" was introduced by [[James Joseph Sylvester|Sylvester]] in an article published in 1878 in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.<ref name="Sylvester">{{cite journal|author=Sylvester, J.J.|year=1878|journal=Nature|title=Chemistry and Algebra|volume=17|pages=284|doi=10.1038/017284a0}}</ref>

One of the most famous and productive problems of graph theory is the [[four color problem]]: "Is it true that any map drawn in the plane may have its regions colored with four colors, in such a way that any two regions having a common border have different colors?" This problem was first posed by [[Francis Guthrie]] in 1852 and its first written record is in a letter of [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] addressed to [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] the same year. Many incorrect proofs have been proposed, including those by Cayley, [[Alfred Bray Kempe|Kempe]], and others. The study and the generalization of this problem by [[Peter Guthrie Tait|Tait]], [[Percy John Heawood|Heawood]], [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] and [[Hugo Hadwiger|Hadwiger]] led to the study of the colorings of the graphs embedded on surfaces with arbitrary [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]].  Tait's reformulation generated a new class of problems, the ''factorization problems'', particularly studied by [[Julius Petersen|Petersen]] and [[Dénes Kőnig|Kőnig]]. The works of Ramsey on colorations and more specially the results obtained by [[Pál Turán|Turán]] in 1941 was at the origin of another branch of graph theory, ''[[extremal graph theory]]''.

The four color problem remained unsolved for more than a century. A proof produced in 1976 by [[Kenneth Appel]] and [[Wolfgang Haken]],<ref name="AA1">{{cite journal|author=Appel, K. and Haken, W.|title=Every planar map is four colorable. Part I. Discharging|journal=Illinois J. Math.|volume=21|year=1977|pages=429–490}}</ref><ref name="AA2">{{cite journal|author=Appel, K. and Haken, W.|title=Every planar map is four colorable. Part II. Reducibility|journal=Illinois J. Math.|volume=21|year=1977|pages=491–567}}</ref> which involved checking the properties of 1,936 configurations by computer, was not fully accepted at the time due to its complexity. A simpler proof considering only 633 configurations was given twenty years later by [[Neil Robertson (mathematician)|Robertson]], [[Paul Seymour (mathematician)|Seymour]], [[Daniel Sanders (mathematician)|Sanders]] and [[Robin Thomas (mathematician)|Thomas]].<ref name="RSST">{{cite journal|author=Robertson, N.; Sanders, D.; Seymour, P. and Thomas, R.|title=The four color theorem|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B|volume=70|year=1997|pages=2–44|doi=10.1006/jctb.1997.1750}}</ref>

The autonomous development of topology from 1860 and 1930 fertilized graph theory back through the works of [[Camille Jordan|Jordan]], [[Kazimierz Kuratowski|Kuratowski]] and [[Hassler Whitney|Whitney]]. Another important factor of common development of graph theory and topology came from the use of the techniques of modern algebra. The first example of such a use comes from the work of the physicist [[Gustav Kirchhoff]], who published in 1845 his [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] for calculating the [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]] in [[electric circuit]]s.

== Graph theory in perspective ==
Graph theory is an important part of mathematics and computer science. To many such problems, exact solutions do exist. Many times however, they are very hard to calculate. Therefore, very often, [[approximation]]s are used. There are two kinds of such approximations, [[Monte-Carlo algorithm]]s and [[Las-Vegas algorithm]]s.

Graphs are normally represented by two different sets, typically set a graph G would be represented as the collection of the sets V and E. The set V is a discrete set containing all vertices of the graph. The set E is a binary set, whose pairwise elements are elements of set V. Each pair in set E represents an edge connecting two vertices.

If every two nodes have an edge between them, then the graph is called the ''complete graph''.

{{multistub|Geo|Europe}}'''History''' is the [[study]] of past events. People know what happened in the past by looking at [[wikt:thing|things]] ''from'' the past, including records (like [[book]]s, [[newspaper]]s and [[letter]]s) and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] (like [[pottery]], [[tool]]s, and human or animal remains). [[Library|Libraries]], [[archive]]s and [[museum]]s collect and keep these things for people to study history. A person who studies history is called a [[historian]]. A person who studies [[pre-history]] and history through things left behind by ancient cultures is called an [[archaeologist]]. A person who studies [[mankind]] and [[society]] is called an [[anthropologist]]. The study of the sources and methods ''used to study and write'' history is called [[historiography]].

People can learn about the past by talking to people who remember things that happened in the past. This is called [[oral history]]. When people who had been [[slavery|slaves]] and [[American Civil War]] [[survivor]]s got old, some historians recorded everything that they said, so that history would not be lost. 

In old times people in different parts of the world kept separate histories because they did not meet each other very often. Some groups of people never met each other. [[Medieval]] [[Europe]], [[Ancient Rome]] and [[Ancient China]] each thought that they ruled the only important parts of the world and that other parts were "[[barbarian]]".

== Aspects of health ==

===Physical health===
Physical fitness refers to good [[human body|body]] health. It is dependent on genetic determinators and also on social, economic and ecological factors. That means, one´s genes are partly responsible for one´s physical health, but also other circumstances: where you live, how clean or polluted your water and the air around you is and also how good your social and medical system is. It is also the result of regular [[exercise]], proper [[diet]] and [[nutrition]], and proper rest for physical [[wikt:recovery|recovery]]. A person who is physically fit will be able to walk or run without getting breathless and they will be able to carry out the activities of everyday living and not need help. How much each person can do will depend on their age and whether they are a man or woman. A physically fit person usually has a normal weight for their height. The relation between their height and weight is called their [[Body Mass Index]]. A taller person can be heavier and still be fit. If a person is too heavy or too thin for their height it may affect their health.<ref> Centers For disease Control and Prevention  http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/effects/index.html</ref>

===Mental health===
Mental health refers to a person's [[emotion]]al and [[psychology|psychological]] well-being. "A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her thinking and emotional (feeling) abilities, [[wikt:function|function]] in [[society]], and meet the [[wikt:ordinary|ordinary]] demands of everyday life."

One way to think about mental health is by looking at how well a person functions. Feeling [[wikt:capable|capable]] and [[wikt:efficient|efficient]]; being able to handle normal levels of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], have good friends and family, and lead an [[wikt:independent|independent]] life; and being able to "bounce back," or [[wikt:recover|recover]] from hardships, are all signs of mental health.

===Public health===
{{Main|Public health}}
[[Public health]] refers to trying to stop a [[disease]] that is unhealthy to the community, and does not help in long life or promote your health. This is fixed by organized efforts and choices of society, public and private clubs, communities and individuals.

It is about the health of many people, or everybody, rather than one person. Public health stops instead of encouraging a disease through [[Disease surveillance|surveillance]] of cases. To prevent being sick, it is good to act according to some simple advice:  [[Hand washing]], regular check-ups,  [[vaccination]] programmes, clean water and using [[condom]]s. When [[infectious disease]]s break out, washing hands for about 30 seconds may be especially important. Sometimes it is necessary to avoid masses of people or wear a surgical mask to protect yourself and to stop the spreading of the disease. Teaching people how to live healthily and educate them, especially about sex and child-birth, is also very important.

[[Category:Basic English 850 words]][[Image:Piraeus harbor 3-2004.JPG|thumb|Ship harbor in [[Greece]]]]

'''Harbour''' means to shelter or keep safe. A '''harbor''' (or '''harbour''') is a place where [[ship]]s may shelter. A [[port]] is also a harbour, but is usually bigger.  The port will often contain a water space with [[breakwarer]]s around the edge, a number of quays or [[pier]]s where the ships may be moored or tied up and a [[transport]] system for taking goods inland. Often [[railway]] and [[road transport]] will be used.  Goods also move by [[pipeline]] transport and by smaller ships on rivers.

Harbors can be natural as in [[San Francisco]] or artificial as in ancient [[Carthage]] or a mix of both. During the [[D-Day]] operations of [[1944]], two artificial harbors (named [[Mulberry harbour|mulberry]]) were built just off the [[beach]]es where the invasion was going to happen.

'''Hawaii''' is a [[U.S. state]]; the only one which is in [[Oceania]]. It is the last state which joined the United States. Hawaii became a state on August 21, 1959. It is the only state made only of [[island]]s. Hawaii is also the name of the largest island. The [[Capital (city)|capital]] and largest city of Hawaii is [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] on the island named [[Oahu]].

Hawaii is known as the "Aloha State". ''Aloha'' is a [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word that has many meanings like welcome, hello and goodbye. Aloha also means love and care. The different meanings are brought together in the term "Aloha Spirit" to describe the friendly people of Hawaii.

The state [[flower]] is the yellow [[hibiscus]] (''Hibiscus brackenridgei'' or {{lang|haw|ma'o hau hele}}). The state [[bird]] is the [[Nene|Hawaiian goose]] (nene). The state [[fish]] is the [[reef triggerfish]], also called the ''{{lang|haw|humu humu nuku nuku apua'a}}''. The state [[tree]] is the [[candlenut]], also called ''kukui''. The state [[song]] is [[Hawaii Ponoi]]. The state [[motto]] is ''{{lang|haw|Ua mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono}}''. In English it says, ''The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness''.

The first people of Hawaii were [[Polynesians]]. They came to the islands sometime between 200 and 600 AD. [[Captain]] [[James Cook]] is given [[credit]] for discovering the islands for the Europeans in 1778. Others may have been there before him. Captain Cook named the islands the Sandwich Islands for the fourth Earl of Sandwich, [[John Montague]].

[[Kamehameha I]] was the first [[king]] of Hawaii. He united the separate small Hawaiian kingdoms into one large kingdom in 1795. In 1893, American soldiers stopped Queen [[Liliuokalani]] from leading Hawaii when American business people took over the government and made their own laws. She was the last [[monarch]] of Hawaii. She also wrote the original words of the song called ''Aloha Oe''.

The American business people made Hawaii into a [[republic]] for a short time. The new leader, [[Sanford Dole]] was called the President of Hawaii. In 1898, the United States of America took over the government and made Hawaii into a [[territory]]. In 1959, Hawaii became the fiftieth American state.

Hawaii is an [[archipelago]], a long chain of islands. There are eight main islands and many small islands and [[atoll]]s. They are the tops of underwater [[volcano]]s. The main islands are [[Niihau]], [[Kauai]], [[Oahu]], [[Molokai]], [[Lanai]], [[Kahoolawe]], [[Maui]] and [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]].

The biggest [[industry]] of Hawaii is [[tourism]]. Almost 7 [[million]] people visited in 2000. Important [[export]]s are [[sugar]], [[pineapple]], [[macadamia nut]]s, and [[coffee]].

Popular [[tourist site]]s include [[Waikiki Beach]], [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]], [[Polynesian Cultural Center]], and the [[USS Arizona Memorial]] at [[Pearl Harbor]].

==Etymology==
Honolulu means "sheltered harbor" in the Hawaiian language. No one knows for sure when Honolulu was first settled or when the name was first used.

==History==
Honolulu harbor was called Kulolia before foreigners came. The first foreigner was Captain William Brown of the English ship Butterworth, in 1794. He named the harbor Fair Haven. Other foreign captains is started calling it Brown's Harbor. The name Honolulu was used some time after that.

Honolulu quickly became the most important harbor of Hawaii. At that time, [[sandalwood]] was a big export. Honolulu was also an important supply point for [[whaler]]s.

Kamehameha III made Honolulu the capital city of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] in 1850. It was also the capital of the [[Republic of Hawaii]] and the [[Territory of Hawaii]]. It stayed the capital when Hawaii became a state in 1959.

The '''Island of Hawaiʻi''' is the largest of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Hawaiian Islands]], and the most southern. Called locally the "Big Island," its area is 4,038 sq. miles (10 458 square kilometers).  The widest part of the island is 93 miles (150 km) across.
The Big Island makes up more than half (~62%) of the total land area of the  [[Hawaii|State of Hawaii]] and is governed by the [[Hawaii County, Hawaii|County of Hawaii]].

The island is built from seven separate [[shield volcano]]s that erupted more or less one at a time, one partly covering the other. The later volcanoes mostly buried two of the earlier ones. These are (from oldest to youngest): [[Kohala]] ([[extinct volcano|extinct]]), Ninole (extinct, mostly buried), [[Mauna Kea]] ([[Dormant volcano|dormant]]), [[Hualalai]] (dormant), [[Mauna Loa]] ([[Active volcano|active]]), Kulani (extinct, mostly buried), and [[Kilauea]] (very active). The volcanos, and the islands, were the result of the Pacific oceanic [[tectonic]] plate moving over a [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]. There [[lava]] from the Earth's lower [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] or upper [[Earth's core|core]] is close to the surface.

The largest city on the island is [[Hilo]]. Hilo is filled with historic buildings, interesting shops, parks and has a constant stream of performances, festivals and events. It is on the rainy east side of the [[island]]. The city of [[Kailua-Kona]] is on the [[:wikt:dry|dry]] west side of Hawaii, and is popular with [[tourists]].

[[Category:National anthems]]'''Healing''' is a process that happens in the [[body]]. Through healing, [[cell]]s are able to repair damaged [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]].
There are two different ways healing can happen:
* The damaged tissue is replaced with tissue of the same kind. This is called ''regeneration''.
* The damaged tissue is replaced with [[scar]] tissue. This is called ''repair''

Most healing processes combine both ways of healing.

[[Category:Tissues]]People have lived in [[Australia]] for about 40,000–60,000 years. The first people who arrived in what is now Australia were the [[Australian Aborigines]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]].<ref name="dfat.gov.au">[http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/history.html Australia in Brief: Ancient heritage, modern society – Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]</ref> Aborigines came by [[boat]] from the [[island]]s of what is now [[History of Indonesia|Indonesia]]. They lived in all parts of Australia. Their lives were simple, they had very few needs. They lived by [[hunting]], [[fishing]] and gathering.

Aborigines invented tools like the [[boomerang]] and spear, but did not farm. Tradition was very important in their lives. Their religion is called the [[Dreaming (spirituality)|Dreaming]], which has lots of stories about the creation of the world by spirits. [[Aboriginal art]] started at least 30,000 years ago and there are lots of Dreaming stories painted on walls and cut in rocks all around Australia. [[Australian Aboriginal music|Aboriginal music]] has songs about the Dreamtime, sometimes with special instruments like the [[didgeridoo]].

In 1606 the first European, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] explorer [[Willem Janszoon]] (1571–1639), visited the west[[Luis Vaez de Torres|de Torres]] sailed through the water between Australia and [[Papua New Guinea]] later that year.{{fact|date=November 2014}} 
Only after Dirk Hartog chanced upon the west coast in 1616 did other European vessels visit and map the coast. After sixty more ships visited the coast,{{fact|date=November 2014}} enough was known for a map to be published in 1811.  The land was dry because of not much rain; some was a [[desert]]. The explorers thought no [[crop]]s could be grown and so it would be difficult for people to live there. They decided there would be no [[economic]] reasons to stay. 

In 1642, Dutchman [[Abel Tasman]], working for the [[Dutch East Indies Company]] reached [[Tasmania]], which he called [[Antony van Diemenslandt]]. He then called the continent he charted the north coast of on his second visit in 1644 [[New Holland]]. In 1688, the privateer [[William Dampier]] became the first Englishman to reach Australia. But in 1770 a British sailor, Captain [[James Cook]], found the fertile east coast of Australia. He called it [[New South Wales]], and claimed it for Britain.<ref name="dfat.gov.au"/>
Englishman [[Matthew Flinders]] published his map of the coast in 1814, calling it [[Australia]] for the first time, a name later formally adopted by the authorities.

==Colonial Australia==

[[File:Adelaide North Tce 1839.jpg|thumb|Adelaide in 1839. [[South Australia]] was founded as a free-colony, without convicts.]]
[[File:Victoria Parliament House Melbourne.jpg|thumb|The Parliament of Victoria, in [[Melbourne]].]]

The British decided to use the land visited by [[Captain Cook]] as a prison colony. Britain needed a place to send its [[convict]]s (people who had been sent to [[jail]] for [[theft]] and other [[crime]]s) because its [[gaol]]s were full and it had just lost its American colonies in the [[American War of Independence]]. In 1788 the British [[First Fleet]] of 11 ships, carrying about 1500 people arrived at [[Sydney]]. [[Arthur Phillip]] led them as the first [[Governor of New South Wales]]. About 160 000 convicts were brought to Australia from 1788 until 1868. Free immigrants began arriving in the 1790s.<ref name="dfat.gov.au"/>

For the first few years they did not have much [[food]], and life was very hard. But soon they began to [[farm]], and more people came. Sydney grew, and new towns were started. [[Wool]] brought good money. By 1822, many towns had been set up and people from the towns often visited Sydney for additional economic resources.

Soon people from [[Sydney]] found other parts of Australia. [[George Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders]] sailed south to [[Tasmania]] and a colony was started at [[Hobart]] in 1803. [[Hamilton Hume]] and [[William Hovell]] went south from Sydney by land. They found the [[Murray River]], and good land in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. [[Thomas Mitchell]] went inland, and found more rivers. In 1826, the first [[British military]] outpost was set up at [[King George Sound]] in [[Western Australia]]. The [[Swan River Colony]] was started in 1829, with townsites at [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. In 1836, a free-settler colony was started in [[South Australia]], where no convicts were ever sent. [[Queensland]] became a separate colony in 1859. As the towns and farms spread across Australia, the Aboriginal people were pushed off their land. Some were [[kill]]ed, and many [[die]]d from [[disease|illness]] and hunger. Soon, Australia's Aborigines were outnumbered by Europeans, and many were made to live on reserves.

The goldrushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_gold_rush|title=New South Wales gold rush|first=|last=|date=|website=wikipedia.org|publisher=|accessdate=6/10/2016}}</ref> The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry. By 1853 the goldrushes had made some poor people very rich.

Convict transportation ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. The first governments in the colonies were run by Governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy. The [[New South Wales Legislative Council]], was created in 1825 to advise the [[Governor of New South Wales]], but it was not chosen by voters. [[William Wentworth]] established the [[Australian Patriotic Association]] (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]] for New South Wales. In 1840, the [[Adelaide City Council]] and the [[Sydney City Council]] were started and some people could vote for them (but only men with a certain amount of money). Then, Australia's first [[parliament]]ary elections were held for the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. ''The Australian Colonies Government Act'' [1850] allowed constitutions for New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.<ref>[http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/righttovote.htm The Right to Vote in Australia – Australian Electoral Commission]</ref> In 1850 elections for legislative councils were also held in the colonies of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/reform.htm Australia’s major electoral developments Timeline: 1788 – 1899 – Australian Electoral Commission]</ref>

In 1855, limited self government was granted by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. A new [[secret ballot]] was introduced in Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia in 1856, allowing people to vote in private. This system was copied around the world. In 1855, the [[right to vote]] was given to all men over 21 in [[South Australia]]. The other colonies soon followed.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Women were given the vote in the [[Parliament of South Australia]] in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections. In 1897, [[Catherine Helen Spence]] became the first female political candidate.<ref name="aec.gov.au">{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=AEC.gov.au |publisher=AEC.gov.au |date=25 Oct. 2007 |accessdate=27 Jun. 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8 Documenting Democracy] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/60vtMmmE7|date =2011-08-14}}</ref>

Australians had started parliamentary democracies all across the continent. But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament.

Australia and New Zealand fought to get Australia.

[[Category:History of Australia| ]]'''Spain''' is a [[country]] in [[Europe]]. 
== Early History ==
People have lived on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] for about 500,000 years. [[Neanderthal]] man came about 200,000 years ago. Modern humans first came about 40,000 years. 

The [[Roman Empire]] controlled Spain for three hundred years; then people from Eastern Europe called [[Visigoths]] fought for Spain, won it from the Romans, and controlled Spain for over two hundred years.
[[File:Dama de Elche.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Lady of Elche]] made by the [[Iberian]]s]]

==9th century==
The Visigoths converted from [[Arian Christianity]] to [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]].  The land was won after a war by [[Muslims]] who were [[Arab]] and [[Berber people|Berber]].  Roman Catholics from Europe eventually decided to fight to take Spain from the Muslims. They fought wars for many hundreds of years, some of which were [[Crusades]] against other [[Christian]]s like the [[Cathar]]s. These were very cruel wars. 

In the year [[1492]], they took the last part of Spain that had belonged to the Moors. [[Boabdil]], the last [[Moor]]ish Leader of [[Granada]], gave the city to King Ferdinand of Aragon on [[2 January]] [[1492]], and Christians now ruled all of Spain.

Before this, several different kings had ruled different countries in what is now called Spain. Two of these countries, [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]], came together when the king of Aragon, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]], married the queen of Castile, [[Isabella of Castile|Isabella]].

In the same year, 1492, they decided to send [[Christopher Columbus]] to explore the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Columbus found a land there that the people of Europe did not yet know. These were the islands of the [[Caribbean Sea]].

== Late 15th century ==
Columbus and other sailors explored more and found that there were two [[continent]]s there - [[North America]] and [[South America]]. Spain sent many soldiers and businessmen to North and South America, and they took over very large parts of those two continents. Owning this [[empire]] made Spain very rich. But when they conquered that empire, they killed millions of the [[Native American]]s who had lived there before. Spain owned this empire for more than three hundred years.

Meanwhile, at home, the Muslim manuscripts had been either burnt or spread to other countries. Jews had been expelled from Spain. The multicultural society was destroyed, and so was the learning. Among the few things kept and respected in Spain were in [[music]]: [[harmony]] and [[stringed instrument]]s, and of course the buildings, many of which became churches, by adding crosses.

== 16th and 17th centuries ==
The [[Spanish Empire]] was the strongest in the world through most of the next two centuries, thanks to [[gold]] from the [[Americas]]. This new gold made rulers and colonial governors rich. Meanwhile others' savings became worth less due to [[inflation]]. Spain became a society of very rich and very poor. Some of the poorest went to the new colonies in the [[Caribbean]], [[Central America]] and [[South America]], mostly to find gold.

[[Native American]] peoples were killed by [[disease]]s brought by the Spaniards, but most Spaniards did not know this. They found damaged and dying societies with people who had lost some of their most important leaders and thinkers. The Spaniards thought this meant they were inferior, and used this as an excuse to enslave the natives. Millions of natives died mining gold for the Spanish.

The Spanish Empire also at this time funded the [[Spanish Inquisition]] which tortured and killed anyone who disagreed with the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The [[Reformation]] which created [[Protestant]] [[sect]]s in Europe was not allowed into Spain, it was kept out and, as with Jews or Muslims, its believers were killed.

The [[noble]]s of Spain no longer had to fight anyone since the internal feuds were over. No one could challenge their power. In many ways it was held together as a [[reign of terror]]. People who challenged them were often called [[heretic]]s, so that the Inquisition could torture them, and then nobles take the property.

For ordinary people on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], life got worse. A few rulers got rich. Today we would say that these people were guilty of [[war crime]]s, [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]]. Many Church people who had the power to speak out at that time, did so, and they said many of the same things as we would say today. But none of this mattered much to the rulers.

The great [[satire]] [[Don Quixote]] was written about this time.

== 18th century==
In the [[18th century]], there was doubt over who should become king of Spain; this doubt led many of the kings of Europe to fight to become king of Spain. This was called the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. 

France occupied Spain for a long time. This made Spain very weak. It also made Spain lose its empire in North and South America; all of the parts of that empire became their own countries, or were taken over by other countries such as the [[United States|United States of America]].

== 20th century ==
There was not much peace in Spain during the first part of the [[20th century]]. Some [[Spaniards]] tried to set up a government chosen by the people (a [[democracy]]), and they made the [[King]] of Spain leave the country. However, in [[1936]], two different groups of [[Spaniards]] went to war over whether the government should be a democracy, or take orders from one person. In [[1939]], those who wanted democracy were defeated, and a [[dictator]] named [[Francisco Franco]] took over the government.

Franco died in [[1975]]. He had decided that [[Spain]] should have a king again, and he chose [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]], the grandson of the king who had been forced to leave the country, to be king. But the king did not rule as a dictator; instead, he chose to set up a democracy. Also since Franco's death, Spain appointed [[Adolfo Suárez]] to became Spain's first democratically elected [[Prime Minister of Spain|prime minister]]. Now Spain is a modern democratic country, and does [[business]] with many countries around the world. It is a part of the [[European Union]].

[[Category:History of Spain| ]][[Image:Height.svg|thumb|right|Height]]
'''Height''' is the [[distance]] between the lowest end and highest end of an [[wikt:object|object]].

For example, people consider the bottom of the foot a person's lowest end, and the top of the head a person's highest end. If the distance between the bottom of a person's foot and the top of that person's head is 64 [[inch]]es, then that person's height is 64 inches.

[[Category:Occupations]]The '''human body''' is the [[body]] of a [[person]]. It is the physical structure of a person. 

The body is a thing that can be hurt or killed. Its functions are stopped by [[death]].

== Study of the human body ==
[[File:Anterior view of human female and male, with labels.jpg|thumb|right|The bodies of two humans of the opposite [[sex]].]]
Some people [[Research|study]] the human body. They look at where it is different from or the same as other [[animal]]s' bodies. These animals can be alive today. Or they can be [[extinct]] animals like other [[hominid]]s. (Hominids are [[primate]]s that are close to humans. [[Neanderthal]]s and ''[[Homo erectus]]'' were hominids.) Some people study how the human body works and lives in its [[environment]]. Some people study what people think about their body. Artists study how to draw or paint the human body.

== Fields of study ==
Many different fields of study look at the human:
* [[Biology]] is a field of [[science]]. It studies living things. It looks at how the human body works. It studies how the human body came from [[evolution]]. It studies how [[genetics]] makes the human body.
** [[Anatomy]] studies the parts of the body and how they work together.
** [[Ecology]] studies the environment including how humans affect it.
* [[Anthropology]] is a field of science. It compares humans to other [[hominid]]s. It also studies all other hominid bodies. They look at how [[human]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s are the same or different.
* [[Psychology]] is a field of [[medicine]]. It looks at how people think and feel. The [[brain]] is part of the body. How we think and feel comes from the brain. So psychologists study the body. They study how the brain lets us be who we are.
* [[Religion]] also talks about the body. Some religions see the body as where the [[soul]] lives. Some see the body as like a [[church]]. This is because a church is where people [[worship]] [[God]]. These people think God should be worshiped inside people. Some religions think the body is made from [[chakras]] that connect us to the [[universe]].
* [[Medicine]] sees the body like a [[machine]]. [[Medical doctor|Doctors]] want to fix problems with the body. They study how to fix the problems, called [[disease]]s.

== The human body and other animals ==
Scientists think that the human body is very much like other animals. They see that some human ''behaviors'' are like animal behaviors. (Behaviors are the way an [[organism]] acts.) They know that 98% of the [[DNA]] in humans is the same as other [[primate]]s.

=== DNA sequence differences between humans and chimpanzees ===
The animal that is alive now that is closest to humans is the [[chimpanzee]]. '''98.4%''' of the DNA is the same between humans and chimpanzees. However, this applies only to single nucleotide [[polymorphism]]s, that is, changes in ''single'' base pairs only. The full picture is rather different.

The draft sequence of the common chimpanzee [[genome]] was published in 2005. It showed that the regions which are similar enough to be aligned with one another account for 2400 million of the human genome’s 3164.7 million bases,<ref name=Consortium>{{cite journal | author = The Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium | year = 2005 | title = Initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | issue = 1 September 2005 | pages = 69–87 | doi = 10.1038/nature04072 | pmid = 16136131|bibcode = 2005Natur.437...69. }}</ref> that is, '''75.8% of the genome'''. 

This 75.8% of the human genome is 1.23% different from the chimpanzee genome in single-nucleotide polymorphisms<ref name="Consortium"/> (SNPs - changes of single DNA “letters” in the genome). Another type of difference, called 'indels' (insertions/deletions) account for another ~3% difference between the alignable sequences.<ref name="Consortium"/> In addition, variation in copy number of large segments (> 20 kb) of similar DNA sequence provides a further 2.7% difference between the two species.<ref name=Cheng>{{cite journal | author = Cheng Z. ''et al.'' | year = 2005 | title = A genome-wide comparison of recent chimpanzee and human segmental duplications | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | issue = 1 September 2005 | pages = 88–93 | doi = 10.1038/nature04000 | pmid = 16136132 | bibcode=2005Natur.437...88C}}</ref> Hence the total similarity of the genomes could be as low as about 70%.

'''Hydrogen''' is a [[chemical element]].  Its [[atomic number]] is 1, which makes it the simplest, known [[Chemical element|element]] in the entire [[universe]].<ref name="EIA">[http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energyfacts/sources/IntermediateHydrogen.html EIA.doe.gov - What is Hydrogen?]</ref> Hydrogen is the true primordial substance, the first atom produced after the [[big bang]]. All chemical elements were formed from hydrogen by the processes of [[nuclear fusion]].<ref>Carroll, Bradley W. & Ostlie, Dale A. 2006. ''An introduction to modern astrophysics''. 2nd ed, Addison-Wesley, San Francisco. ISBN 0-8053-0402-9</ref>

Hydrogen glows [[purple]] when it is in [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] [[state of matter|state]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.chemrec.se/Syngas_the_link_from_feedstock_to_synthetic_product.aspx |title=The magic of syngas |first= |last= |work=chemrec.se |year=2012 [last update] |accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref>

== Hydrogen in nature ==
In its pure form on Earth, hydrogen is usually a [[gas]]. Hydrogen is also one of the parts that make up a [[water]] molecule. Hydrogen is important because it is the [[fuel]] that powers the [[Sun]] and other stars.
Hydrogen makes up about 75% of the entire [[universe]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/971113i.html |title=Hydrogen in the Universe |first= |last= |work=imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov |year=2012 [last update] |accessdate=7 March 2012}}</ref> Hydrogen's symbol on the [[Periodic Table]] of Elements is H.

Pure hydrogen is normally made of two hydrogen [[atoms]] connected together. Scientists call these [[diatomic]] [[molecules]]. Hydrogen will have a [[chemical reaction]] when mixed with most other elements. It has no [[color]] or [[Odor|smell]]. 

Pure hydrogen is very uncommon in the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]]. In nature, it is usually in [[water]].  Hydrogen is also in all living things, as a part of the [[organic compounds]] that living things are made of.  In addition, hydrogen atoms can combine with [[carbon]] atoms to form [[hydrocarbons]].  [[Petroleum]] and other [[fossil fuels]] are made of these [[hydrocarbons]] and commonly used to create energy for human use.

Hydrogen has two different [[isotopes]], called [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]]. Like regular hydrogen, they both have only one [[proton]] and one [[electron]], but deuterium also has one [[neutron]] and tritium has two. These other types of hydrogen are important in [[nuclear energy]] and [[organic chemistry]] reactions. 

Some other facts about hydrogen:
* It is a gas at [[room temperature]]
* It acts like a [[metal]] when it is solid.
* It is the lightest element in the [[Universe]].
* It is the most common element in the Universe.<ref name="EIA" />
* It burns or [[explosion|explodes]] when it touches a [[fire|flame]].

== History of Hydrogen ==
Hydrogen was discovered in 1671 by Robert Boyle even though many people think it was discovered by Henry Cavendish in 1776.

=== The word ===
The name 'Hydrogen' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for [[water]], 'υδορ (pronounced /HEEW-dor/) and gennen meaning to "generate" as it forms water in a [[chemical reaction]] with oxygen.

== Uses of Hydrogen ==
The main uses of hydrogen are in the [[petroleum]] industry and in making [[ammonia]] by the [[Haber process]]. Some is used elsewhere in the [[chemical]] industry. A litte of it is used as [[fuel]], for example in [[rocket]]s for [[spacecraft]]. Most of the hydrogen that people use comes from a [[chemical reaction]] between [[natural gas]] and [[steam]]. 

=== Hydrogen as fuel (fusion) ===

[[Nuclear fusion]] is a very powerful source of [[energy]]. It relies on forcing [[atom]]s together to make [[helium]] and energy, exactly as happens in a [[star]] like the [[Sun]], or in a [[hydrogen bomb]]. This needs a large amount of energy to get started, and is not easy to do yet. A big advantage over [[nuclear fission]], which is used in [[nuclear power]] stations, is that no waste is produced, and no toxic [[fuel]] like [[uranium]] is needed.

There is more than 600 million tons of hydrogen undergoing fusion every second on the Sun.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.iter.org/sci/whatisfusion |title=What is Fusion? |first= |last= |work=iter.org |year=2012 [last update] |accessdate=7 March 2012|publisher=ITER Organization}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/qa_sun.html|title=NASA's Cosmicopia|publisher=NASA|accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>

=== Burning Hydrogen ===
1. Water can be easily broken down into hydrogen and oxygen with [[electricity]], but it takes a lot of electricity to get a usable amount of hydrogen.

2. Burning hydrogen combines with oxygen molecules to make [[steam]] (pure water vapour).

3. A fuel cell combines hydrogen with an oxygen [[molecule]] releasing an electron as electricity.

=== Hydrogen power grid ===
For these reasons, many people believe hydrogen power will eventually replace [[technology|technologies]] such as [[diesel-electric]] [[engine]]s and [[biodiesel]] fuel.

But it is not correct to see hydrogen as a fuel if it is used in a fuel cell.  It is more of a replacement for the [[power grid]].  Such a grid and [[infrastructure]] with new [[vehicle]]s might be first made in [[Iceland]], a country that has much free [[geothermal energy]] and is quite small.  Because it [[import]]s all [[fossil fuel]], it would help Iceland to completely stop using it. The huge advantage of hydrogen is that when burnt in an engine or in a fuel cell, there is no pollution. Only a small amount of water forms.

[[File:Goodyear-blimp.jpg|thumb|right|Because it is very light, helium is the gas of choice to fill [[airship]]s such as the [[Goodyear blimp]]]]
'''Helium''' is a [[chemical element]]. It has the [[chemical symbol]] '''He''', [[atomic number]] 2 and atomic weight of about 4.002602. There are 9 isotopes of helium, only two of which are stable. These are <sup>3</sup>He and <sup>4</sup>He. <sup>4</sup>He is by far the most common isotope.

Helium is called a [[noble gas]], because it does not regularly mix with other chemicals and form new [[Chemical compound|compounds]]. It has the lowest [[boiling point]] of all the elements. It is the second most common element in the [[universe]], after [[hydrogen]], and has no color or smell. However, Helium has a blue-ish, neon color when being burnt with fire. Helium does not usually [[Chemical reaction|react]] with anything else. Astronomers discovered helium in [[1868]]. They found that it was in the [[Sun]] before it was found on [[Earth]]. Because of where it was found, its name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for Sun, ''helios''.

Helium is used to fill [[balloon]]s and [[airship]]s because it is [[density|lighter]] than [[air]], and does not burn or react, meaning it is normally safe for using it in that way. It is also used in some kinds of [[light]] bulbs. People also breathe it in to make their [[voice]]s sound higher than they normally do as a [[joke]], but this is extremely dangerous if they breathe in too much, since it can kill them because they are not breathing normal air. Breathing too much helium can also cause long-term effects to [[vocal cords]].

It can be created through the process of [[nuclear fusion]] in the [[Sunderland A.F.C.|sun]] we are currently trying to harness nuclear fusion as a form of power but this is still at an early stage because the sun can [[Quantum tunneling|quantum tunnel]] enough because of its huge size). During this process, four Hydrogen atoms are fused together to form one Helium atom.

[[Category:Noble gases]]The '''home page''' of a [[web site]] is the [[wikt:document|document]] that a [[server|web server]] sends to another [[computer]]'s [[web browser]] [[Computer software|application]] when it has been contacted without a request for specific information. That is, when you enter only a [[domain name]] in the Address box without specifying a directory or a file, the ''home page'' is usually the first part of the web site you will be taken to. The Home Page is also called the Main Page.

A properly written home page will tell a user about the information available in the web site, and how to view different parts of the web site.

The home page of ''simple.wikipedia.org'' can be found [[Main Page|at this link.]]

'''Home Page''' was a popular computer application used for composing [[web page]]s.

== In Linux servers ==
In [[Linux]]-based servers, the homepage usually is index.html, index.php, index.cgi, etc. Unless the website administrator has created a [[URL redirection|redirect]] to a specific webpage.

== In Windows servers ==
However, in [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based servers, the homepage is default.html, default.php, etc. This is a problem for website administrators to install website applications like [[MediaWiki]]. Mainly because most website applications are created with the homepage as index.php (for [[PHP]] applications).

[[Category:Websites]][[File:Beautiful healty hair.JPG|thumb|Long, brown hair]] '''Hair''' is something that grows from the [[skin]] of [[mammal]]s. Animal hair is usually called '''[[fur]]'''. [[Sheep]] and [[goat]]s have curly hair, which is usually called [[wool]]. Hair is made of [[keratin]]<nowiki/>s, which are [[protein]]s.

[[Human]]s and some other [[animals]] have lost much of their hair through [[evolution]], and some other mammals, such as the [[elephant]] and the [[whale]], have almost none at all.

==Functions of hair==
[[File:Just one lion.jpg|thumb|The male lion's mane has several functions]]
Hair can have different functions:<ref>http://www.keratin.com/aa/aa031.shtml</ref>
*It can protect against losing body heat. This is thought to be the basic, original function of hair.<ref>http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-do-humans-get-goosebu</ref><ref>http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/whats-point-pubic-hair</ref>
*It protects against [[UV]] [[radiation]], which damages the skin.
*It can protect against rain or water. Air can be trapped in the fur, or oil can be secreted by the skin. Both these methods prevent the rain or water from  making the body too cold. Aquatic mammals in cold waters usually have blubber (fat) under the skin, and almost no hair.
*Defence: hair is modified in mammals like [[porcupines]], for protection.
*Hair colouring works for various functions. In some animals. for [[camouflage]]. Or, for signalling to others of the same [[species]]. Examples are: signalling to females for mating purposes and signalling to others for territory control. Signalling danger to other species ([[aposematic]] colouring) is also done by, for example, [[skunk]]s.
*Animals can change their hair so they look bigger, or more threatening. This can also be used for mating; which is the case with [[lion]]s, for example. Also, the male lions' mane also protects their neck from damage when fighting other males.

==False hair==
Some animals, for example certain [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s also have ''hairs''. However these are not hair in the biological sense, but are actually [[bristle]]s. The ''hairs'' found on certain plants are also not true hair, but [[trichome]]s.

== Human hair ==
[[Image:Mark Twain-Shirtless-ca1883.jpg|right|thumb|A man with hair on his head, face, and body.]]
In [[human]]s, hair grows mostly on the [[head]], and the amount of body hair is different from [[race (sociology)|race]] to race. [[Asian]]s and native North Americans have the least amount of body hair, while [[Caucasian]]s tend to have the most.<ref>http://www.belgraviacentre.com/blog/hair-types-and-race-differences/</ref>

=== Hair color ===
[[File:Hair colors.jpg|thumb|230px|Different human hair colors; From top to left, clockwise: [[black]], [[brown]], [[blonde]], [[white]], [[red]].]]
Hair color is passed down by parents only. Natural hair color can be given only by [[genes]]. It is impossible to have a hair color that is not passed down [[genetics|genetically]] by both mother and father. This relies on [[dominant]] and [[recessive]] [[genes]] carried by a parent.  These genes may not be the color of their hair, however, many people carry [[genes]] that are [[recessive]] and do not show in their traits or features.

[[Dye]]ing hair is to change the color of hair. It consists of a [[chemical]] mixture which can change the color of hair by a [[chemical]] reaction. Many people dye their hair to hide gray or white hairs.  This is because most people gain white or gray hairs as they grow older.

==== Genetics and chemistry ====
Two types of [[melanin]] pigment give hair its color: ''eumelanin'' and ''pheomelanin''. Pheomelanin colors hair red. Eumelanin determines the darkness of the hair color. A low concentration of brown eumelanin results in blond hair, but more brown eumelanin will color the hair brown. High amounts of black eumelanin result in black hair, while low concentrations give gray hair. All humans have some pheomelanin in their hair.

The genetics of hair colors are not yet firmly established. According to one theory, at least two gene pairs control human hair color.

One phenotype (brown/blond) has a [[dominant]] brown [[allele]] and a [[recessive]] [[blond]] allele. A person with a brown allele will have brown hair; a person with no brown alleles will be blond. This explains why two brown-haired parents can produce a blond-haired child.

The other gene pair is a non-red/red pair, where the not-red allele  is dominant and the allele for red hair is recessive. A person with two copies of the red-haired allele will have red hair, but it will be either auburn or bright reddish orange depending on whether the first gene pair gives brown or blond hair, respectively.

The two-gene model does not account for all possible shades of brown, blond, or red (for example, platinum blond versus dark blonde/light brown), nor does it explain why hair color sometimes darkens as a person ages. Several other gene pairs control the light versus dark hair color in a cumulative effect ([[quantitative genetics]]).

=== Hair texture ===
Hair texture is also inherited genetically. The thickness of hair, its color and its tendency to curl are all inherited. There are also genetic differences between men and women. Body hair is limited in women, and thicker in men.

=== Hair loss ===
[[File:Ad van Liempt.jpg|thumb|Typical male pattern baldness]] People have about 100,000 hairs on their head.  About 100 fall out each day, but they usually grow back. Some men are bald but girls and women may become bald if they lose their hair from a disease called [[Alopecia]].

Men often lose some of their hair as they grow older. This is known as ''baldness''. Doctors call it "[[male pattern baldness]]" because hairs often fall out in similar places. It often begins by hair falling out first from the front of the head, and then from the top of the head. After a while, all that may be left is a some hair running above the ears and around the lower back of the head. Even though it is unusual for women to go bald, many women suffer from thinning hair over the top of their head as they grow old.

People have tried to find cures for hair loss for thousands of years. In an effort to get their hair back, men have tried "cures" like applying strange lotions or even having their heads packed in [[chicken]] [[manure]].<ref>http://hisrad.org/what-are-the-causes-of-hair-loss-in-women/</ref>{{fact|date=April 2009}} Many unproven "cures" are still marketed today. It is only in the last decade or so that [[treatment]]s have been developed which do sometimes work. Some doctors do hair [[transplant]]s, where they take tiny plugs of hair from areas like the back of the neck and plant them in the bald spots on the head. Some [[drug]]s have been tested and approved for sale as hair loss treatments. They encourage hair regrowth and thickening, but work better if applied before hair loss turns to baldness.

=== History and culture ===
[[File:Orit's Cornrows work.jpg|thumb|A braided hairstyle]] [[File:Visualfan.jpg|thumb|A bold hair color and style]] People have been interested in hair on their heads for hundreds of thousands of years. For both men and women, styling and coloring hair have been ways to look good, and get attention. Sometimes society makes rules about hair, for example by not allowing people to cut their hair or [[beard]]s, like in [[Sikhism]] (it is also good to do this in Islam, but not a requirement).<ref>http://www.islamic-laws.com/beard.htm</ref>

[[Category:Hair| ]]{{about|the island of Ireland}}

[[File:LocationIslandIreland.png|thumb|250px|Ireland on a map of [[Europe]]]]
[[File:Topography Ireland.jpg|thumb|250px|Topographical map of Ireland]]
'''Ireland''' is an [[island]] in [[Europe]]. To the west of Ireland is the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; to the east of Ireland, across the [[Irish Sea]], is the island of [[Great Britain]].

The island of Ireland is about 486 [[Kilometer|km]] (302 [[miles]]) long and about 288&nbsp;km (179 miles) wide. About 6.4 million people live on the island {{ndash}} 4.6 million in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and 1.8 million in [[Northern Ireland]].

The [[River Shannon]], which runs from north to south, is the longest river on the island. Ireland has many [[lake]]s. Lough Neagh, in Northern Ireland, is the largest lake in Ireland. Ireland is known for its beautiful landscapes, [[music]], history, and [[mythology]].

Today, the island of Ireland is split between two countries:

* The [[Republic of Ireland]] is five sixths (83%) of the island. Its capital city is [[Dublin]]. The official languages are [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]]. Most people in the country can speak a little Irish, but only a small number of the population are fluent or native speakers. Almost everyone learns Irish at school, but most people outside the [[Gaeltacht]] speak [[English language|English]] in their day-to-day lives.
* [[Northern Ireland]] is the remaining one sixth (17%) of the island and is part of the [[United Kingdom]]. The capital of Northern Ireland is [[Belfast]].

Many people live in the eastern coasts of both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Dublin has a population of more than one million, and the Greater Belfast region has a population of nearly half a million.

==Provinces and counties==
Ireland is traditionally divided into four provinces and thirty-two counties. Twenty-six counties are in the Republic and six in Northern Ireland. Three of the provinces are entirely within the Republic (Connacht, Leinster and Munster), and one province (Ulster) has some counties in both the Republic and in Northern Ireland.
* [[Connacht]] - Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo
* [[Leinster]] - Carlow, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Longford, Louth, Meath, Offaly, Westmeath, Wexford, Wicklow
* [[Munster]] - Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford
* [[Ulster]] - Cavan, Donegal, Monaghan (Republic of Ireland); Antrim, Armagh, Derry/Londonderry, Down, Fermanagh, Tyrone (Northern Ireland)

==Main cities==
[[Dublin]] is the largest city. It is capital of the Republic of Ireland. Dublin was established as a Viking settlement in the 9th century. The population is 525,383 in Dublin City, and 1,270,603 in Co. Dublin.{{when}}

[[Belfast]] is the capital of Northern Ireland. It has 483,000 people in the Greater Belfast urban area there are 267,000 in the city itself.{{when}} Shipbuilding used to be a major industry here. The ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' was built in Belfast at the Harland and Wolff shipyard.

[[Armagh]] is a city in Northern Ireland. It is often called the 'Ecclesiastic Capital of Ireland' as it is the seat of both the [[Catholic Church]] and the (Protestant) [[Church of Ireland]]. The population is 14,590.{{when}}

[[Cork (city)|Cork]] is the largest city in Munster. Corconians often jokingly refer to it as 'the Real Capital'. The population is 119,230.{{when}}

[[Derry]], also known as Londonderry, is the second largest city in Northern Ireland. Derry is notable for the Medieval city walls which still stand. Because the walls have never been breached, the city is nicknamed "The Maiden City". In 2013 Derry/Londonderry was the UK Capital of Culture. Many cultural events took place there during the year. The population is 83,652.{{when}}

==History==
During the [[last glacial period]] (the "ice age"), most of Ireland was covered with ice. After that, Ireland became covered with trees. The first people came to Ireland about 9,000 years ago, in the Middle [[Stone Age]] (Mesolithic period). They were nomadic. Once food ran out in the place they lived, they would move to another place. Evidence of these people was found in Mount Sandel, Co. Derry. 

About 4000 BC, in the New Stone Age (Neolithic period), the first farmers arrived in Ireland. These people cleared openings in the forest and built permanent settlements with houses and farmland. When people in this age died, they were buried in tombs called megaliths. Many megaliths are left standing today, such as portal dolmens and passage tombs. The most famous megalith is Newgrange passage tomb in co. Meath. 

New settlers came around 2000BC, marking the start of the [[Bronze Age]]. Copper was mined mainly in Mount Gabriel, co. Cork, and tin was imported from Cornwall. These people used bronze to make weapons, such as swords. They also used it to make early forms of jewellery, such as sun discs and torcs. These settlers buried the dead in court tombs or wedge tombs, and burial places have been found with stone circles. 

It is unknown when the [[Celts]] came to Ireland, but it is likely they brought the use of iron with them. The use of iron marks the start of the [[Iron Age]]. It is known that by about 300BC, the use of iron and Celtic culture was widespread in Ireland. The Celts lived in ring forts, hill forts, promontory forts and crannógs. It is thought that only the richer families and settlements lived in crannógs. These were man-made islands in the middle of lakes with houses on them. 

Celtic Ireland was split into around 150 kingdoms called tuath. The king was elected from the royal family. Below the king were the Nobles, and the Aos Dána, who were people with special skills, such as poets, Druids (priests), judges and craftsmen. 

By the early 6th century, Ireland was mostly Christian through the work of [[St. Patrick]] and other missionaries. [[Druids]] were replaced by priests and monks. Monasteries soon were built such as Glendalough in co. Wicklow. Glendalough and other monasteries built round towers for safety when [[Vikings]] attacked. Small monasteries were also built in remote places, the most famous being Skellig Michael, off the coast of co. Kerry. 

At this time many hand-written manuscripts were created by the monasteries. They include the Cathach, the Book of Durrow, and the Book of Kells. Monks also produced fine silver chalices, croziers and brooches, and carved high crosses. 

In 1169, [[Anglo-Norman]] lords invaded Ireland. They were led by [[Strongbow]]. He landed at Passage, Co. Waterford. The Anglo-Normans conquered many parts of Ireland the following 60 years. They introduced their way of life. The feudal system was soon introduced in Ireland as means of organising land. Castles were built to defend the land like Trim Castle, co. Meath. During the Middle Ages, Ireland's first proper towns were built. 

From 1801 until 1922, all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1921 Northern Ireland was created and 'partitioned' from the south. Northern Ireland has stayed within the United Kingdom since then. The full name of the UK is 'The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'.

In 1922 the south became the [[Irish Free State]]. In 1937 the Irish Free State adopted a new constitution which named the state '[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]', and in 1948 this state passed the Republic of Ireland Act which declared it to be a [[republic]].

==Migration==
Many Irish people have left Ireland and moved to the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[South America]]. The [[Irish Potato Famine|Great Famine]] in the 1840's forced many to leave; it is estimated almost a million people died of starvation, and a million more emigrated. From a maximum of over 8 million in 1841, the total Irish population dropped to just over 4 million in the 1940s. Since then, the population has grown to over 6 million. This has been helped by the economic growth of the "Celtic Tiger" and since 2004 immigration from countries in [[Eastern Europe]] such as [[Poland]].

Today almost 80 million people around the world are descended from Irish immigrants.

Ireland's main sport is Gaelic football.

[[Category:Divided regions]][[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|319x319px|Internet [[map]]]]

The '''internet''' is an informal term for the world-wide communication [[computer network|network]] of computers.   

The internet is used to send information quickly between computers around the world.  It has millions of smaller domestic, [[academic]], [[business]], and [[government]] networks and websites, which together carry many different kinds of [[information]] (facts and details) and services. So in other words, the Internet is a network of networks.

== History ==
The internet was developed in the [[United States]] by the "[[United States Department of Defense]] Advanced Research Projects Agency" ([[DARPA]]). It was first connected in October, 1969,<ref>{{Cite web
 |url= http://www.walthowe.com/navnet/history.html
 |title=A brief history of the internet
 |work=walthowe.com
 |accessdate=13 July 2010
}}</ref> and was called [[ARPANET]]. The [[World Wide Web]] was created
at [[CERN]] in [[Switzerland]] in 1990 by a [[United Kingdom|British]] ([[UK]]) [[man]] named [[Tim Berners-Lee]].

Today, people can pay [[money]] to access the internet from [[internet service provider]]s. Some services on the Internet cost nothing to use. Sometimes the people who offer these free services use [[advertising]] to make money from them.
The alternative (other) name, "net" came from "inter(net)".

== Services on the internet ==
The internet is used for many things, such as [[electronic mail]], [[online chat]], [[computer file|file]] transfer, and the interlinked [[web page]]s and other documents of the [[World Wide Web]].

The most used service on the internet is the World Wide Web (which is also called the "Web"). The Web contains [[website]]s, [[blog]]s, and also [[wiki]]s like [[Wikipedia]]. [[Webpage]]s on the internet can be seen and read by anyone (unless the page needs a [[password]], or it is blocked).

The second biggest use of the internet is to send and receive e-mail. E-mail is private and goes from one [[:wikt:user|user]] to another. [[Instant messaging]] (such as [[AIM]] or [[ICQ]]) is similar to email, but allows two or more people to chat to each other much faster.

Some governments think the Internet is a bad thing, and block all or part of it.  For example, the Chinese government thinks that Wikipedia is bad. Many times no one in [[China]] can read it or add to it.<ref>{{cite web|author=posted by abennett |url=http://www.itworld.com/040614wikipedia |title=Chinese censors block access to Wikipedia |publisher=ITworld |date=2004-06-14 |accessdate=2009-10-16}}</ref> Some [[parent]]s block parts of the internet they think are bad for [[child]]ren to see. Well-known examples of the whole internet being blocked are in [[North Korea]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Internet_enemies_2009_2_.pdf |title=Rapport @ 09 GB |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-10-16}}</ref> and Myanmar.

==  Dangers on the internet==
The internet can also be a dangerous place. Information that people put on the internet is not always checked, and some may not be true. Some may even be harmful. Also, if someone sends information through the internet, sometimes other people can read it even when they are not supposed to. For example, [[Facebook]] has had some problems with [[wikt:privacy|privacy]] settings. A person can post information on a website, but this is often a bad idea unless the person is very sure of what they are doing. A good way to check for a secure website is to make sure the [[URL]] starts with <nowiki>https://</nowiki> instead of <nowiki>http://</nowiki>, this means it is a secure site. (This only stops other people from reading what a user types. It does not mean the website is safe)
* Some websites may trick people into [[download]]ing [[computer virus|viruses]] that can harm a computer or [[spyware]] that [[spy|spies]] on its users (looks at what they are doing and tells someone else).  E-mails can also have harmful files with them as "attachments".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wiredsafety.org/internet101/viruses.html |title=Internet Safety: Internet 101 - Viruses, worms and Trojans |publisher=Wiredsafety.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-16}}</ref>
* In [[IRC|internet chatrooms]], people might be preying on others or trying to [[stalking|stalk]] or [[abuse]] them.
* The internet contains content that many people find offensive such as [[pornography]], as well as content intended to be offensive.
* Criminals may [[Identity theft|steal people's personal information]] or [[Internet fraud|trick people into sending them money]].

==Geography==
{{further|Italian Peninsula}}[[File:Satellite image of Italy in March 2003.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Satellite (artificial)|Satellite]] image of Italy]]
Italy is a [[peninsula]], meaning it is encompassed by the sea on all of its sides apart from one side of the country (its north side). Northern Italy is separated from [[France]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Austria]] by the [[Alps]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blurtit.com/q714533.html|title=Alps are the border between Italy and other countries}}</ref> a chain of mountains. [[Mont Blanc]] (''Monte Bianco'' in Italian or white mountain in English), the highest mountain in western [[Europe]],<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1940971.stm| publisher = BBC News | accessdate = 23 July 2009 | date = 20 April 2002 |title = Four missing in Alps avalanche}}</ref> belongs to this chain. The second important chain of mountains in Italy is the [[Apennines]] (''Appennini'' in Italian), which are in central and southern Italy.

The [[Capital (city)|capital]] of Italy is [[Rome]]. Other cities in Italy are [[Milan]], [[Turin]], [[Florence]], [[Genoa]], [[Naples]], [[Palermo]] and [[Venice]]. The country has a number of islands, the biggest of which are [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldislandinfo.com/LARGESTV1.html|title=Biggest Islands in the World}}</ref><ref name=Encarta>{{citeweb|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555207/italy.html|title=Italy: Encarta|publisher=MSN|accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref> which can be reached by ship or [[aircraft]].<ref name=Encarta />

The [[Po River]] is the longest river in Italy. It flows through 5 cities: Torino, Piacenza, Cremona Ferrara and Rovigo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0205/feature6/index.html |title=National Geographic |accessdate=2009-07-20 |last=Zwingle |first=Eria |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=National Geographic |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> The [[Tiber River]] runs through the city of [[Rome]].

Northern Italy has some of the biggest lakes in the country, such as [[Lake Garda]], [[Lake Como]], [[Lake Maggiore]] and [[Lake Iseo]].<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2005/mar/19/italy.guardiansaturdaytravelsection | work = The Guardian | date = 19 March 2005 | accessdate = 23 July 2009| title = The lake show |first = Philip | last=Watson}}</ref> Because it is surrounded by the sea, Italy has many [[kilometer]]s of [[coast]], which brings [[tourism|tourists]] from all over the world.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3896487.stm | publisher = BBC News | accessdate = 23 July 2009 | date = 15 July 2004 | title = Tourism damaging Med's wetlands}}</ref>  Tourists also come to see Italy's many [[history|historical]] places.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2496923.stm | publisher = BBC News | title = Alarm sounded over Italy's treasures | date = 20 November 2002 | accessdate = 23 July 2009 }}</ref>

Two very small countries are located within Italy. They are [[San Marino]], which is surrounded by part of Northern Italy, and the [[Vatican City]], which is inside Rome.  

== People and culture ==
[[File:Leonardo self.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leonardo Da Vinci]]]]
People from Italy are called Italians. Nearly all the Italians are [[Christian]]s, and most of these are [[Roman Catholic]]s, which is based in the Vatican City and home to its leader, the [[Pope]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/it.html|title=Italy|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=2009-07-25}}</ref>

The [[population]] of Italy is a little over 60 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://flagcounter.com/factbook/it |title=Flag Counter: Italy |accessdate=2009-07-11 |format= |work= }}</ref> About 2.7 million of them live in [[Rome]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.routard.com/guide/rome/1823/carte_d_identite.htm|title=Rome's Population}}</ref> and 1.3 million in [[Milan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmilan.com/the-city-of-milan.html|title=Milan's Population}}</ref> As of 31 December 2015, over 5 million foreigners were living in Italy, which is 8.3% of the total population.<ref>{{cite web|title=National demographic balance, 2015|url=http://www.istat.it/en/archive/186990|work=www.istat.it|publisher=Italian Government|accessdate=6 September 2016|date=16 June 2016}}</ref>

The official language of Italy is [[Italian language|Italian]] and in some small areas German, Slovenian or French. People also speak languages such as Sicilian and Sardinian, which are very [[wikt:similar|similar]] to Italian, but are different dialects of Italian.

There are many different dialects spoken in Italy. They vary between regions and, in some cases, also between provinces.

The people of Italy are partly [[descendant]] from the [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]].

Italy is home to more [[World Heritage Site]]s than any other nation in the world.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/|title=List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref> These sites are culturally important and valued according to [[UNESCO]]. About 60% of the works of [[art]] of the world are in Italy. Italy is also a big [[wine]] producer. In 2005 it made over 5 million tonnes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Wine_production_by_country|title=Countries by wine Production}}</ref>

== Economy ==

Italy has a modern social welfare system. The labor market enjoys relative strength, with many foreigners, especially from [[Romania]], working in Italy where the wages are much higher. But it could have been much more workers on the labor market because men and women already retired in the age of 57 and the unemployment rate is relatively high at 8.2 percent.<ref>http://www.pensionfundsonline.co.uk/113/country-profiles/italy/</ref><ref>http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2011/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2009&ey=2016&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=136&s=LUR&grp=0&a=&pr.x=16&pr.y=16</ref> Italy's modern society has been built up through loans and now the country has a catastrophic high debt of €1.9trn or 120 percent of the country's total GDP.

The country's oldest religious minority is the [[Judaism|Jewish]] community. It has roughly 45,000 people. It is no longer the largest non-Christian group.
About 825,000 [[Muslim]]s live in Italy. Most of them immigrated.<ref>[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/about-the-fco/country-profiles/europe/italy UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office]</ref> (1.4% of the total population) Only 50,000 are [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizens]].

== Regions ==
Italy is [[wikt:divide|divided]] into 20 Regions (''Regioni'' in Italian) and every Region is divided into [[Provinces of Itally|Provinces]].

There are 20 Regions. 5 of them have a special status, they are called ''autonomous''. This means that they can make certain local laws more easily. These regions are marked with an [[asterisk]] (*) below.

== Politics ==
[[File:Obelisk of montecitorio arp.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]]]]

The [[Head of state|Head of State]] is [[Sergio Mattarella]], whose task began in February 2015. Mattarella is currently the President of the Italian Republic. The first president was [[Enrico De Nicola]].

The [[Head of government|Head of Government]] is [[Matteo Renzi]], who became [[Prime Minister]] on [[February 22]], [[2014]], succeeding [[Enrico Letta]]. Renzi was previously the [[Mayor]] of [[Florence]] and is Italy's youngest-ever [[Prime Minister]], at age 39 when taking office.

Italy was one of the first members of the [[European Union]] and in 2002, along with 11 other European countries, it changed to using the [[euro]] as its official [[currency]]. Before this, the [[Italian lira]] had been used since 1861.

Anyone who wants to be President of Italy must have Italian citizenship, be at least 50 years old, and must be able to hold political and [[civil rights]].

== History ==
[[File:Colosseum in Rome, Italy - April 2007.jpg|thumb|The [[Colosseum]] in Rome. Its original name is Flavian Amphitheatre, being built under the [[Flavian dynasty]], an imperial Family of the Ancient Rome.]]
[[File:Leaning tower of pisa 2.jpg|thumb|[[Leaning Tower of Pisa]]]]
Before 1861, Italy was not a [[state]]. The area was made of a group of independent states, ruled by other countries (such as Austria, France, and Spain). In the 1850s the [[Earl]] of [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Camillo Cavour]] was the Head of Government of the "State of Sardinia". He talked to the Austrians in Lombardy and Veneto and said they should create a Northern Italian state. This happened, but other Central and Southern Italian states also joined Piedmont to create a bigger state.

In 1860, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] took control of Sicily, creating the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861.<ref name=Encarta /> [[Vittorio Emanuele II]] was made the King. But, in 1861, Latium and Veneto were still not part of Italy, because they were ruled by the [[Pope]] and Austrian Empire.

Veneto was made part of Italy in 1866 after a war with Austria, and Italian soldiers won Latium in 1870. That was when they took away the Pope's power. The Pope, who was angry, said that he was a prisoner to keep [[Catholicism|Catholic]] people from being active in politics. That year, Italy finally came back together.

Italy participated in [[World War I]] as an [[ally]] of [[Great Britain]], [[France]], and Russia against the [[Central Powers]]. Almost all of Italy's fighting was on the Eastern [[border]], near Austria. After the "[[Caporetto]] defeat", Italy thought they would lose the war. But, in 1918, the Central Powers [[wikt:surrender|surrender]]ed, and Italy gained the Trentino-South Tyrol, which once was owned by Austria.

In 1922, a new Italian government started, and it was ruled by [[Benito Mussolini]], the leader of [[Fascism]] in Italy. He became [[Head of Government]] and [[dictator]], calling himself "duce" - which means "[[leader]]" in [[Italian language|Italian]]. He became friends with German dictator Hitler, and Mussolini followed him into [[World War II]]. Italy entered the war in 1940 as an ally of [[Germany]] and [[Japan]] against France, Great Britain, and [[Russia]]. During the war, Italy controlled most of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

On [[July 25]], 1943, Mussolini was removed by the Great Council of Fascism, and, on [[September 8]], 1943, [[Badoglio]] said that the war as an ally of Germany was ended. Italy started fighting as an ally of France and the UK, but Italian soldiers did not know who to shoot. In Northern Italy, a [[wikt:movement|movement]] called [[Italian resistance movement|Resistenza]] started to fight against the German [[invasion|invaders]].

Mussolini tried to make another Northern Italian [[Fascism|fascist]] state, the [[Republic of Salò]], but it failed. On [[April 25]], 1945, Italy became free. The state became a republic on [[June 2]], 1946, and, for the first time, women were able to vote. Italian people ended the Savoia [[dynasty]] and adopted a republic government.

In February 1947, Italy signed a peace treaty with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] losing all the colonies and some territorial areas ([[Istria]] and parts of [[Dalmatia]]).

Since then Italy has joined [[NATO]] and the European Community (as a founding member), becoming one of the seven biggest industrial economies in the world.

'''If''' is a word to describe a statement where one thing depends on something else. 

For example:
*We can call this true ''if'' there is proof.
*We will play outside ''if'' it does not rain.

'''''If —''''' is a poem written by [[Rudyard Kipling]]. It appeared in the ''Brother Square Toes'' chapter of Kipling's book ''Rewards and Fairies''. In a [[1995]] [[BBC]] opinion poll, it was voted [[Britain|Britain's]] favourite poem. It is arguably Kipling's most famous poem.

[[Category:Basic English 850 words]][[File:Island_Pokonji_Dol.jpg|thumb|right|A small island]]
An '''island''' is a piece of ground that is surrounded by a body of water such as a lake, river or sea. Water is all around an island. Islands are smaller than [[continent]]s.

Arrange the following island in order of their sizes, the largest first. The largest island in the world is [[Greenland]], unless [[Australia]] is believed to be an island. 

Some islands are their own countries. Examples of islands that are their own countries include [[Cuba]], [[Iceland]], and [[Madagascar]]. There are many others. Other islands have more than one country, such as [[Borneo]] and [[Hispaniola]].

{{disambig}}{{unreferenced|date=February 2012}}
An '''idiom''' is a [[word]] or [[phrase]] which means something different from its literal meaning. Idioms are common phrases or terms whose meaning is changed, but can be understood by their popular use. 

Because idioms can mean something different from what the words mean it is difficult for someone not very good at speaking the language to use them properly. Some idioms are only used by some groups of people or at certain times. The idiom ''shape up or ship out'', which is like saying ''improve your behavior or leave if you don't'', might be said by an employer or supervisor to an employee, but not to other people.

Idioms are not the same thing as [[slang]]. Idioms are made of normal words that have a special meaning known to almost everyone. Slang is usually special words, or special meanings of normal words that are known only to a particular group of people.

To learn a language a person needs to learn the words in that language, and how and when to use them. But people also need to learn idioms separately because certain words together or at certain times can have different meanings. In order to understand an idiom, one sometimes needs to know the culture the idiom comes from.

To know the history of an idiom can be useful and interesting, but is not necessary to be able to use the idiom properly. For example, most native British English speakers know that "No room to swing a cat" means "there was not a lot of space" and can use the idiom properly, but few know it is because 200 years ago sailors were punished by being whipped with a whip called a "cat o'nine tails".{{cn|date=February 2012}} A big space was cleared on the ship so that the person doing the whipping had a lot of room to ''swing the cat''.

A better understanding of an idiom is that it is a phrase whose meaning cannot be understood from the dictionary definitions of each word taken separately.

==Some common idioms==

* ''Break a leg''
: A way to wish someone good luck.
* ''To live it up''
: To enjoy life, to live widely
* ''To kick the [[bucket]]''
: To die.
* ''Shape up or [[ship]] out''
: Used to tell someone that they should leave if they don't improve their [[behavior]] or performance
* ''To shed [[crocodile]] tears''
: To cry about something but without actually caring.
* ''Wild [[goose]] chase''
: A useless journey or pursuit.
* ''There's no room to swing a cat''
: There is not a lot of space.
* ''To pay through the nose''
: To pay a lot of money, more than is normal.
* ''To bark up the wrong tree''
: To choose the wrong course of action.
* ''To spill the beans''
: To tell a secret.
* ''It's raining cats and dogs''
: It's raining heavily.
* ''To get into hot water''
: To get into trouble.
* ''To be [[chicken]]-hearted''
: To be scared.
* ''Top dog''

[[Category:Figures of speech]]The '''International English Language Testing System''' (IELTS) tests how good you are at the [[English language]]. People who take the test take the Academic Module or the General Training Module. The academic one is for people who want to go to university. The general one is for people who want to do other training or want to get work experience. People who want to emigrate to a country that uses English also take the general one.

Most universities in Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States accept the IELTS. Many professional companies do as well.

'''Ink''' is a [[liquid]] that is used to [[write]], [[draw]], print, or make marks. The word ink is from [[Latin language|Latin]] and means "colored water". Ink is used in [[pen]]s, in some computer printers, and in [[printing press]]es. In some countries, people write by using ink and [[brush]]es. People usually write or print using black ink, but ink can be any [[color]]. The first ink was used in [[Egypt]] about 2600 BC.

A disadvantage of many kinds of ink is that they may smudge when wet, spoiling the picture or writing. 

The first inks were carbon inks, made from soot, which is 80% [[carbon]], water and [[gum arabic]]. Red ink would need [[iron oxide]] (such as [[haematite]]) from ground rocks instead of soot. Later, in Europe, people used iron gall ink. This is the kind of ink [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] used. Now ink colours are produced by [[dye]]s.

Ink in a ball point pen is held in a thin long [[cylinder]] (tube) inside the pen. The ink does not fall out of the cylinder as it sticks to the sides of the tube.

[[Category:Art]]The '''inch''' is a unit of [[length]] in the [[Imperial unit|Imperial system]] and the [[United States customary units|United States customary system]]. The [[abbreviation]] for inches is '''in''' or '''"'''. There are 12&nbsp;inches in a [[Foot (unit of length)|foot]]. One inch is equal to 2.54&nbsp;[[centimetre]]s.

The word "inch" came from [[Middle English]] ''unche'', which came from [[Old English]] ''ynce'', from [[Latin]] ''uncia'' meaning "a twelfth part".

== History ==

The inch was originally defined as 3 [[Barleycorn (unit)|barleycorns]]. The inch was finally standardised in the International Yard and Pound Treaty in 1959 between the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]]. The international yard was made equal to 0.9144 [[metre]]s. From this, subdivisions and multiples of the yard were specifically defined.

== Usage ==

In the [[United States]], people use inches more than they use [[millimetre]]s or [[centimetre]]s. In the rest of the world, [[International System of Units|international units]] are almost always used. The inch is not used by scientists.

In the United Kingdom, [[Traffic sign|road signs]] that show how high a vehicle can be in order to pass through a [[tunnel]] are required to be in feet and inches. [[Theme park]]s and [[Drive-through|drive thru]] signs usually show it in metres. People regularly measure their [[height]] in feet and inches. Official medical records, however, are required to record people's height in [[Metric system|metric]] measurements only.

In Canada, a mix of centimetres and inches are used in height. Older generations, especially, use Imperial units. A lot of exposure to [[Americanisation|Americanized]] phrases leads to younger generations often having a good understanding of both the Imperial and metric systems.

In the United States, height is always in feet and inches. Science is the only field to use metric measurements.

Other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, including [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and [[Jamaica]] use inches to varying degrees. From every day use to exclusively the older community.

[[Category:Imperial units]]The '''pint''' (abbreviated '''pt.''') is a unit of volume in [[Imperial units|Imperial]] and [[U.S. customary units|U.S. units]]. There are several types of pints used in different countries. An Imperial pint and U.S. pint both equal {{frac|1|2|}} of a quart and {{frac|1|8|}} of a gallon.

An Imperial fluid ounce is approx. 4% smaller than a U.S. fluid ounce although an Imperial pint has 4 more fluid ounces than a U.S. pint making 1 Imperial Pint roughly 20% larger than a U.S. pint in total.

==Imperial Pint==
The Imperial pint is the pint used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Burma]]. The unit may appear in other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries that converted to the [[Metric System]]. Confusion in Canada often arises as liquids are often sold in U.S. pints although the official and only pint that is legal in Canada is the Imperial pint. The Imperial system has no dry pint and volume in dry units e.g. apples are the same as liquid pints. 1 Imperial pint of water at 62 °F (16.7 °C) weighs 1{{frac|1|4|}} lbs. (566.99 g)

|}

==U.S. Wet Pint==
The U.S. wet pint or more commonly 'pint' is the unit used to measure volume in the [[United States of America|United States]]. It is more common than the dry pint which is used for non-liquid volume measurements. 1 U.S. pint of water at 62 °F (16.7 °C) weighs 1.04375 pounds lbs. (473.437g)

|}

==U.S. Dry Pint==
The U.S. dry pint is the unit used for measuring the volume of solid objects instead of by mass or quantity. E.g. a pint of strawberries is a container with a volume of 1 dry pint full of strawberries. 
{| class="wikitable"

|}

==Usage==
* The Wet and Dry U.S pints are still commonly used in the United States.
*In Canada it is commonly used for alcohol although a pint can vary from 12 fl oz to 20 fl oz and is sometimes incorrectly given in U.S. fl oz
*In the United Kingdom and Ireland: milk, alcohol and cooking ingredients/tools are often given in pints, although due to E.U regulations most liquids are now given in [[Metric system|metric units]] with occasional dual units.
*In the United Kingdom milk is often sold in metric quantities equivalent to Imperial pints.

[[Category:Imperial units]]
[[Category:Units of volume]]The word '''Italian''' may mean:
*Anything related to the country of [[Italy]]
**[[Italians]], people of Italy
**[[Italian cuisine]], food of Italy
**[[Italian language]]

{{main|History of India}}
Two of the main Classical languages of the world— [[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]], were born in India. Both of these languages are more than 3000 years old. The country founded a [[religion]] called [[Hinduism]], which most Indians still follow. Later, a king called Chandragupt maurya built an empire called the [[Maurya Empire]] in 300 BC. It made most of [[South Asia]] into one whole country.<ref>{{cite web

After 1947, India has had a socialist planned economy. It is one founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[United Nations]]. It has fought many [[war]]s since independence from [[Britain]], including in 1947-48, 1965, 1971, and 1999 with [[Pakistan]] and in 1962 with [[People's Republic of China|China]]. It also fought a war to capture [[Goa]], a [[Portugal|Portuguese]]-built [[harbour|port]] and city which was not a part of India until 1961.

India's government is divided into three parts: the Legislative (the one that makes the laws, the Parliament), the Executive (the government), and the Judiciary (the one that makes sure that the laws are obeyed, the supreme court).

The legislative branch is made up of the [[Parliament]] of India, which is in [[New Delhi]], the capital of India. The Parliament of India is divided into two groups: the upper house, Rajya Sabha (Council of States); and the lower house, Lok Sabha (House of People). The Rajya Sabha has 250 members,<ref name="Parliament">{{cite web

The executive branch is made up of the [[President]], [[Vice President]], [[Prime Minister]], and the Council of Ministers. The President of India is elected for five years. The President can choose the Prime Minister, who has most of the power. The Council of Ministers, such as the Minister of Defence, help the Prime Minister. Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of India on May 16, 2014. He is the 19th Prime Minister of India.

The judicial branch is made up of the [[court]]s of India, including the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice of India is the head of the Supreme Court. Supreme Court members have the power to stop a law being passed by Parliament if they think that the law is illegal and contradicts (opposes) the [[Constitution]] of India.<ref name="Manorama" /> In India, there are also 24 High Courts.

== Geography and climate ==
[[File:Indiarivers.png|thumb|Rivers of India]]

India is the seventh largest country in the world. It is the main part of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The [[Borders of the Republic of India|countries next to India]] are [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Myanmar]], [[China]], [[Bhutan]], and [[Nepal]]. It is also near [[Sri Lanka]], an [[island]] country.

India is a [[peninsula]], which means that it is surrounded on three sides by water. One of the seven wonders of the world is located in Agra the Taj Mahal. In the west is the [[Arabian Sea]], in the south is the [[Indian Ocean]], and in the east is the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The northern part of India has many mountains. The most famous mountain range in India is the [[Himalayas]], which have some of the tallest [[mountain]]s in the world. There are many rivers in India. The main rivers are the [[Ganges]], the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]], the [[Yamuna]], the Godavari, the Kaveri, the Narmada, and the Krishna.

India has different climates.<ref name="CONCISE ENCYCLOPEDIA 4">{{cite book
|title = Concise Encyclopedia
|publisher = Dorling Kindersly Limited
|year = 1997
|pages = p. 333
|isbn = 0-7513-5911-4}}</ref> In the South, the climate is mainly tropical, which means it can get very hot in summer and cool in winter.<ref name="CONCISE ENCYCLOPEDIA 4"/> The northern part, though, has a cooler climate, called sub-tropical, and even alpine in mountainous regions.<ref name="CONCISE ENCYCLOPEDIA 4"/> The [[Himalayas]], in the alpine climate region, can get extremely cold. There is very heavy [[rainfall]] along the west coast and in the Eastern Himalayan foothills. The west, though, is drier. Because of some of the [[desert]]s of India, all of India gets rain for four months of the year. That time is called the monsoon. That is because the deserts attract water-filled winds from the Indian Ocean, which give rain when they come into India. When the monsoon rains come late or not so heavily, [[drought]]s (when the land dries out because there is less rain) are possible.

== Defence ==
{{Main|Indian Armed Forces}}
The '''Indian Armed Forces''' is the military of India. It is made up of an [[Indian Army|Army]], [[Indian Navy|Navy]] and [[Indian Air Force|Air Force]]. There are other parts like Paramilitary and Strategic Nuclear Command.

The President of India is its Commander-in-Chief. However, it is managed by the Ministry of Defence. In 2010, the Indian Armed Forces had 1.32 million active personnel. This makes it one of the largest militaries in the world.<ref>IISS 2010, pp. 358</ref>

Currently, the Indian Army is becoming more modern by buying and making new weapons. It is also building defences against missiles of other countries.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/18/MNRR11AJK9.DTL&type=science India's army seeks military space program] SFGate.</ref> In 2011, India imported more weapons than any other nation in the world.<ref>http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/html/export_values.php{{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref>

From its independence in 1947, India fought four wars with Pakistan and one war with China.

== Indian states ==
For [[administration]] purposes, India has been divided into smaller pieces. Most of these pieces are called [[state]]s, some are called [[Union territory|union territories]]. States and union territories are different in the way they are represented. Most union territories are ruled by administrators sent by the central government. All the states, and the territories of Dehli, and Puducherry [[election|elect]] their local government themselves. In total, there are twenty-nine states, and seven union territories.<ref name="LOC PROFILE"/>

== Trouble with the borders ==
There are [[wikt:dispute|disputes]] about certain parts of the Indian borders. Countries do not agree on where the borders are. [[Pakistan]] and [[China]] do not recognise the disputed territory of [[Occupied Kashmir]]. The Indian government calls it ''Jammu and Kashmir'' and believes it is an Indian state. Similarly, the Republic of India does not recognise the Pakistani and Chinese parts of Kashmir.

In 1914, [[British India]] and [[Tibet]] agreed on the [[McMahon Line]], as part of the [[Simla Accord (1914)|Simla Accord]]. Indians and Tibetans see this line as the official border. China does not agree, and both mainland China and [[Taiwan]] do not recognize that  Arunachal Pradesh belongs to India. According to them, it is a part of [[South Tibet]], which belongs to China.<ref>{{cite web

Several modern religions are linked to India,<ref name = EB>Adams, C.

Accessed: 5 September 2007</ref> namely modern [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Sikhism]]. All of these religions have different ''schools'' (ways of thinking) and [[tradition]]s that are related. As a group they are called the [[Eastern religions]]. The Indian religions are similar to one another in many ways: The basic beliefs, the way [[worship]] is done and several religious practices are very similar. These similarities mainly come from the fact that these religions have a common history and common origins. They also influenced each other.

The religion of [[Hinduism]] is the main faith followed by 79.80% of people in the Republic of India; [[Islam]] – 14.23%; [[Christianity]] – 2.30%; Sikhism – 1.72%; [[Buddhism]] – 0.70% and [[Jainism]] – 0.37%.<ref name="CensusRel">{{cite web |title=Census of India 2001, Data on Religion |work=Census of India |url=http://www.censusindia.net/religiondata/ |accessdate=April 12, 2007}}</ref>

== Technology ==
India sent a spacecraft to [[Mars]] for the first time in 2014. That made it the fourth country and only Asian country to do so. India is the only country to be successful in its very first attempt to orbit Mars. It was called the Mars Orbiter Mission. It took less money to make than the [[Hollywood]] movie, ''Gravity''.

== Pop culture ==
India has the largest movie industry in the world.{{cn|date=February 2016}} Based in [[Mumbai]] (formerly [[Bombay]]), the industry is also known as [[Bollywood]] (an obvious play on Hollywood). It makes 1,000 movies a year, about twice as many as Hollywood.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.ibtimes.com/bollywood-100-how-big-indias-mammoth-film-industry-1236299|title = Bollywood at 100: How Big is India's Mammoth Film Industry|first = |last = |date = |website = |publisher = IBTimes|accessdate = }}</ref>

{{main|Sports in India}}
India's official national sport is [[field hockey]] which is controlled by the Indian Hockey Federation.  They have also won eight gold, one silver and two bronze medals at the [[Olympic games]]. However, [[cricket]] is the most popular sport in India. The India cricket team won the 1983 and 2011 Cricket World Cup and the 2007 ICC World Twenty20. They [[wikt:share|shared]] the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with [[Sri Lanka]]. Cricket in India is controlled by the Board of Control for Cricket in India or BCCI. Domestic tournaments are the Ranji Trophy, the Duleep Trophy, the Deodhar Trophy, the Irani Trophy and the Challenger Series. There is also the Indian cricket league and Indian premier league Twenty20 competitions.

[[Tennis]] has become popular due to the victories of the India Davis Cup team.

[[Category:India| ]]
[[Category:Gondwana]]An '''insult''' is a description of someone that will [[:wikt:offend|offend]] them. It may or may not be [[truth|true]]. It is called ''derogatory'' language. Terms like [[:wikt:foolish|foolish]], [[:wikt:stupid|stupid]], [[:wikt:idiot|idiot]] and [[:wikt:moron|moron]] are insults, because they say that a person's [[mind]] is not quick or smart.

Insulting someone's mother directly is a serious insult in many [[culture]]s.

[[Ritual]] insults are part of many cultures. For example, they can be found in [[sports]] and [[military]] training. They are also very common in [[jargon]]s. For example, the word ''[[newbie]]'' is a part of [[net jargon]]. Calling someone a newbie is usually insulting.

One should be very careful when using new words to describe others.

==Reason==
Usually, someone insults others because they want to feel like they are better or have more power ([[influence]]) than the people they insult. They may want this because they are actually afraid that they are worse or less powerful than the people they are insulting.

==Effects==
When someone is insulted, his or her [[pride]] is hurt. He or she may want to fight back by insulting the person who insulted him or her.

[[Category:Figures of speech]]'''Immunology''' is the study of the '''[[immune system]]'''. The immune system is the parts of the body which work against [[infection]] and [[parasitism]] by other living things. Immunology deals with the working of the immune system in health and diseases, and with malfunctions of the immune system.

An immune system is present in all plants and animals. We know this because biologists have found genes coding for [[toll-like receptor]]s in many different [[metazoa]]ns.<ref name=Janeway>Janeway, Charles A. 2001. Evolution of the imune system: past, present and future. In Janeway C.A; Travers P; Walport M. & Shlomchik M. 2011. ''Immunobiology: the immune system in health and disease''. 5th ed, Garland, New York. 597{{ndash}}611 ISBN 0-8153-3642-X</ref> These toll-like receptors can recognise [[bacteria]] as 'foreign', and are the starting-point for immune reactions. The type of immunity which is triggered by the toll-like receptors is called [[innate immunity]]. This is because it is entirely [[Heredity|inherited]] in our [[genome]], and is fully working as soon as our [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] are properly developed. 

[[Vertebrate]]s, ''and only vertebrates'', have a second type of immunity. This is called [[adaptive immunity]], because it 'remembers' previous infections. Then, if the same infection occurs again, the reaction is much stronger and faster. This immunological memory "confers a tremendous survival advantage" and with it vertebrates "can survive over a long lifetime in a pathogen-filled environment".<ref name=Janeway/>

== Types of immunity in vertebrates ==
{{main|Immune system}}
=== Innate immune response ===
{{main|Innate immune system}}
The [[innate immune system]] is usually means all of the [[cell]]s and systems that does not have to be exposed to a particular [[pathogen]] before they can work.  

Innate immunity starts with the [[skin]], which is an excellent barrier to [[infection]].

=== Adaptive immune response ===
{{main|Adaptive immune system}}
The [[adaptive immune system]] includes cells and systems that do require previous exposure to a pathogen. It explains the unique ability of the mammalian immune system to remember previous infections and mount a rapid and robust reaction to secondary infections.  This '''immunological memory''' is due to the biology of [[T-cell]]s and [[B-cell]]s.

== Other aspects of immunity ==
[[Vaccine]]s boost the acquired immune system by offering weak forms of infection that the body can fight off. The system remembers how to do it again when a stronger infection happens. If the vaccine works, the body can then fight off a serious infection.

The distribution of vaccines and other immune system affecting [[cure]]s can be considered another level of acquired immune system, one governed by access to [[vaccination]] and [[medicine]] in general.  The intersection of this with the spread of [[disease]] (as studied in [[epidemiology]]) is part of the field of [[public health]].

=== Errors and weaknesses ===
Errors of the immune system may cause damage. In [[autoimmune disease]]s, the body attacks parts of itself because the system mistakes some parts of the body as 'foreign'. Some kinds of [[arthritis]] are caused this way.

Sometimes serious pathogens slip in because their surface is disguised as something the host cell walls can accept. That is how viruses work. Once inside a cell, their genetic material controls the cell. Infections like [[HIV]] get in this way, and then attack cells which are the basis of the immune system. Artificial means are often used to restore immune system function in an HIV-challenged body, and prevent the onset of [[AIDS]].  This is one of the most complex issues in immunology as it involves every level of that system.  This research during the 1980s and 1990s radically changed the view of the human immune system and its functions and integration in the [[human body]].

==History of immunology==


Immunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system. It originates from [[medicine]] and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease. The earliest known mention of immunity was during the [[plague of Athens]] in 430 BC. [[Thucydides]] (460–395 BC) noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of some diseases could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Retief FP, Cilliers L| title=The epidemic of Athens, 430–426 BC| journal=South African Medical Journal |volume=88 |issue=1| pages=50–53 |year=1998 |pmid=9539938}}</ref>

In the 18th century, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis]] made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Ostoya P |title=Maupertuis et la biologie| journal=Revue d'histoire des sciences et de leurs applications| year=1954 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=60–78| url= http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rhs_0048-7996_1954_num_7_1_3379 | doi=10.3406/rhs.1954.3379}}
</ref> This and other observations of acquired immunity led to [[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–1895) developing [[vaccination]] and the [[germ theory of disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Plotkin SA |title=Vaccines: past, present and future |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=11 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=S5–11 |year=2005  |pmid=15812490 |doi=10.1038/nm1209}}</ref> Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the [[miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]]. It was not until the proofs [[Robert Koch]] (1843–1910) published in 1891 (for which he was awarded a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in 1905) that [[microorganism]]s were confirmed as the cause of [[infectious disease]].<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1905/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1905], Nobelprize.org, accessed 8 January 2007</ref> Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, when the [[yellow fever]] virus was discovered by [[Walter Reed]] (1851–1902).<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071023070838/www.wramc.amedd<!--
  -->.army.mil/welcome/history/ Major Walter Reed, U.S. Army], Walter Reed Army Medical Center, accessed 8 January 2007.</ref>

Immunology made a great advance towards the end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of [[humoral immunity]]<ref>In humoral immunity, antibodies are secreted into bodily fluids such as blood and [[lymph]].</ref> and cellular immunity.<ref name= Metch>{{cite book| last =Mechnikov | first = Ilya| coauthors = translated by F.G. Binnie| title =Immunity in infective diseases| publisher =Cambridge University Press | year =1905 | url= http://books.google.com/?id=ywKp9YhK5t0C&printsec=titlepage&vq=Ehrlich&dq=history+of+humoral+immunity| format=full text version: Google Books| isbn=0548-64719-4}}
</ref> Particularly important was the work of [[Paul Ehrlich]] (1854–1915), who proposed the [[side-chain theory]] to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction. The Nobel Prize for 1908 was jointly awarded to Ehrlich and the founder of cellular immunology, [[Ilya Mechnikov]] (1845–1916).<ref>
[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1908/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1908] Nobelprize.org, accessed 8 January 2007</ref>

The simplest form of immunity is the [[DNA restriction]] system in [[bacteria]] that prevents [[infection]] by [[bacteriophage]]s.

[[Category:Immunology| ]]'''Infinity''' is about things which never end. Sometimes, it is also written <math>\\infty</math>. Infinity means many different things, depending on when it is used. The word is from a [[Latin]] word, which means "without end". Infinity goes on forever, so sometimes space, numbers, and other things are said to be 'infinite', because they never come to a stop.

Infinity is not really an ordinary number, but it is sometimes used as one. Infinity often says how ''many'' there is of something, instead of how ''big'' something is. For example, there are infinitely many [[whole number]]s (called [[integer]]s), but there is no integer which is infinitely big. But different kinds of math have different kinds of infinity. So its meaning often changes.

There are two kinds of infinity: [[potential]] infinity and [[wikt:actual|actual]] infinity. Potential infinity is a process that never stops. For example, adding 10 to a number. No matter how many times 10 is added, 10 more can still be added. Actual infinity is a more abstract idea. For example, there are infinitely many numbers as it is impossible to write them all down.

== Infinity in Mathematics ==
[[Mathematicians]] have different sizes of infinity and three different kinds of infinity.<ref name=ax>To simply, we will assume several axioms like the [[Axiom of Choice]] and the [[Generalized Continuum Hypothesis]].</ref>

===Counting infinity===
The number of things, beginning with 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., to include infinite cardinal numbers. There are many different cardinal numbers. Infinity can be defined in one of two ways: Infinity is a number so big that a part of it can be of the same size; Infinity is larger than all of the [[natural numbers]]. There is a smallest infinite number, ''countable infinity''. It is the counting number for all of the whole numbers. It is also the counting number of the [[rational numbers]]. The mathematical notation is the Hebrew letter aleph with a subscrpt zero; <math>\\aleph_0</math>. It is spoken "aleph null". 
It was a surprise to learn that there are larger infinite numbers.<ref name=ax /> The number of [[real numbers]], that is all numbers with decimals, is larger than the number of [[rational numbers]], the number of fractions. This shows that there are real numbers which are not fractions. The smallest infinite number greater than <math>\\aleph_0</math> is <math>\\aleph_1</math>. 
The number of mathematical [[functions]] is the next infinite cardinal number, <math>\\aleph_2</math>.
And these numbers go on without end.

===Ordering infinity===
A different ''type'' of infinity are the [[ordinal numbers]], beginning "first, second, third, ...". The order "first, second, third, ..." and so on to infinity is ''different'' from the order ''ending'' "..., third, second, first". The difference is important for [[mathematical induction]]. The simple ''first, second, third, ... '' has the mathematical name: the Greek letter omega with subscript zero: <math>\\omega_0</math>. (Or simply omega <math>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \\omega</math>.) The infinite series ending "... third, second, first" is <math> ^*\\omega </math>.

===The real line and complex plane===
The third ''type'' of infinity has the symbol <math>\\infty</math>. This is treated as addition to the [[real numbers]] or the [[complex numbers]]. It is the result of division by zero, or to indicate that a [[series]] is increasing (or decreasing) without bound. The series 1, 2, 3, ... increases without upper bound. This is written: the limit is <math>+\\infty</math>. In [[calculus]], the [[integral]] over all real numbers is written: <math> \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} f(x)\\,dx</math>

==The arithmetic of infinity==
Each kind of infinity has different rules.

===Addition, multiplication, exponentiation===

<math>\\aleph_0 + 1 = 1 + \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0 + \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0 </math> Addition with "alephs" is [[commutative]].

<math> 2 \\times \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0 \\times 2 = \\aleph_0 \\times \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0</math> Multiplication with "alephs" is commutative.

<math> \\aleph_0 + \\aleph_1 = \\aleph_1 \\times \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_1</math>

<math> 2 ^ {\\aleph_0} = \\aleph_1 </math>.<ref name=ax />

<math> 1 + \\omega = \\omega \\neq \\omega +1 </math>. Addition with "omegas" is not commutative.

<math> 2 \\times \\omega = \\omega \\neq \\omega \\times 2 </math>. Multiplication with "omegas" is not commutative.

<math> \\omega + \\omega = \\omega \\times 2 </math>

<math> x + \\infty = \\infty = \\infty + \\infty = \\infty \\times \\infty = 2 ^ \\infty </math>

===Subtraction, division===

<math> 1 / \\infty = 0</math> Otherwise, division by infinity is not meaningful. Subtraction with infinity is not meaningful.

'''January''' is the first [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendars, coming between [[December]] (of the previous year) and [[February]] (of the current year). It has 31 [[day]]s. 

== The Month ==
[[File:Sneeuw1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Snow]] in January in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], where it is a [[winter]] month.]]
January is named for [[Janus]], the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[god]] of [[door]]s and [[gate]]s.

January and [[February]] were put on the [[calendar]] after all the other months. This is because in the original Roman calendar, [[winter]] did not have months. Although [[March]] was originally the first month, January became the new first month because that was when people chose the new [[Roman Republic|consul]]s (Roman leaders).

January is a [[winter]] month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and a [[summer]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the seasonal equivalent of [[July]] in the other. [[Perihelion]], the point in its orbit where the [[Earth]] is closest to the [[Sun]], also occurs in this month, between [[January 2]] and [[January 5]]. January has 31 days and starts on the same day of the week as [[October]] in [[common year]]s and the same day as [[April]] and [[July]] in [[leap year]]s. It ends on the same day of the week as [[February]] and [[October]] in [[common year]]s, and ends on the same day as [[July]] in [[leap year]]s. January is the only month of the year that always has a "twin" - a month that starts and ends on the same day of the week as it does. In a common year, this is [[October]]. In a leap year, this is [[July]].

January's flower is the [[carnation]] with its [[birthstone]] being the [[garnet]]. The meaning of the garnet is constancy.

The first day of January is called [[New Year's Day]]. It is said that it became this date when Roman consuls took office on this day in [[153 BC]]. Different calendars across [[Europe]] made this the start of the New Year at different times, as some observed it on [[March 25]].

Reaching over from [[December]], the [[Christmas]] season in [[Christianity]] also extends into this month. Eastern [[church]]es celebrate [[Christmas]] on [[January 6]] or [[January 7]], and [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] on [[January 18]] or [[January 19]] - In Western Christianity this occurs on [[January 6]], with [[Christmas]] occurring on [[December 25]].

'''Japan''' (日本, Nippon) is a [[country]] in [[Asia]]. It has many [[island]]s. Four of them are big, and the biggest is the 7th largest island in the [[world]]. This island is called [[Honshu]]. The islands are near the east Asian coast, in the western part of the [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref name='CIA Factbook' />

Japanese [[people]] call their country "Nihon" or "Nippon",<ref name="CIA Factbook">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ja.html|title=Japan|publisher=[[CIA]]|accessdate=2016-06-19|work=CIA World Factbook}}</ref> which means "the origin of the Sun" in Japanese. Japan has a constitutional democratic government, of which system is called parliamentary cabinet system, where the cabinet exercises political power with parliamentary confidence.<ref name="CIA Factbook" /> Japan also has a [[Prime minister]] and an Emperor and Empress.<ref name="CIA Factbook" /> About 13 million people live in Tokyo, which is the capital city of Japan.

==History==
{{Main|History of Japan}}
The earliest records on Japan are from [[China|Chinese]] documents. One of those records said there were many small countries (in Japan) which had wars between them and later a country, ruled by a queen, became the strongest, unified others, and brought peace.

The Japanese began to write their own history after the [[5th century|5th]] and [[6th century|6th centuries]], when people from [[Korea]] and China taught Japan about the [[Chinese writing system]]. Japan's neighbours also showed them the ways of [[Buddhism]].<ref name='Japan history'>{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2131.html |title=Early Japan (until 710) |accessdate=2009-06-16 |work=japan-guide.com }}</ref> The Japanese changed Buddhism in many ways, for example, by building strongly on ideas such as [[Zen]], which came from mainland Asia.<ref name='Japan history' />

In the ancient and the [[Middle Ages]], China gave Japan many new cultural ideas, but their friendship became weaker later. In the late [[13th century]], [[Mongol Empire|Mongolians]] from China tried to invade Japan twice, but they could not.<br />
The [[samurai]] and [[shogun]] of Medieval Japan are similar to knights and lords in Medieval [[Europe]].

Japan had some contact with the Europeans in the [[16th century]]. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] were the first Europeans to visit Japan. Later, the [[Spain|Spanish]], [[England|English]] and [[Holland|Dutch]] came to Japan to trade. Also, they brought [[Christianity]]. Japan's leaders welcomed them at first, but because Europeans had conquered many places in the world, the Japanese were scared they would conquer Japan too. So the Japanese did not let the Europeans come into Japan anymore, except in a small area in [[Nagasaki]] city. Many Christians were killed. Only the Chinese, Korean and Dutch people were allowed to visit Japan, in the end, and they were under careful control of the Japanese government. Japan was opened for visitors again in [[1854]] by Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]], when the [[United States|Americans]] wanted to use Japanese ports for American [[whale]] boats. Perry brought steamships with guns, which scared the Japanese into making an agreement with him.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/teach/ends/opening.htm |title=Perry & Opening of Japan |work=history.navy.mil |year=2009 [last update] |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}</ref>

This new contact with Europeans and Americans changed the Japanese culture. The [[Meiji Restoration]] of [[1868]] stopped some old ways and added many new ones. The [[Empire of Japan]] was created, and it became a very powerful nation and tried to invade the countries next to it. It invaded and [[annexation|annexed]] [[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyu]] Kingdom, [[Taiwan]], and Korea. It had wars with China and Russia: the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Boxer Rebellion]] the [[Russo-Japanese War]], and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], which grew to become a part of [[World War II]] when Japan became allies with [[Nazi Germany]] and Fascist Italy.

In 1941, Japan attacked [[Pearl Harbor]] in [[Hawaii]], a water base of the United States, and destroyed or damaged many ships and airplanes. This started the United States' involvement in [[World War II]]. American and Japanese forces fought each other in the Pacific. Once airbases were established within range of the Japanese mainland, America began to win, and started dropping bombs on Japanese cities. America was able to bomb most of the important cities and quickly brought Japan close to defeat. To make Japan surrender, the United States dropped two [[atomic bomb]]s on the cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], killing 150,000 Japanese citizens. Soon after this the [[Soviet Union]] began to fight against Japan, and the Japanese army in [[Manchuria]] lost. Japan surrendered and gave up all the places it took from other countries, accepting the [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]] Proclamation. The United States occupied Japan and forced it to write a new [[constitution]], in which it promised to never go to war again.

==Geography==
[[File:Mountfujijapan.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Fuji]] with [[cherry blossom]] trees and a [[shinkansen]] in the foreground—all three are iconic of Japan]]
Japan is a group of islands in the Western [[Pacific]], off the coast of China. The four biggest islands are [[Honshu]], [[Hokkaido]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Kyushu]], and there are about 6,000 smaller islands there. Japan is separated from the Asian continent by the [[Sea of Japan]] and the East China Sea. Honshu, which means 'Mainland' in the [[Japanese language]], is the biggest island. Hokkaido is the island north of Honshu. Kyushu is the island west of Honshu. Shikoku is the island to the south-west of Honshu.<ref name='CIA Factbook' />

In the middle of Japan there are mountains.<ref name='CIA Factbook' /> They cover the middle of the islands and leave a very narrow strip of flat land on most coasts. Many of the mountains are extinct [[volcano]]es, but some are still active. The highest of these mountains is the beautiful, volcano-shaped Mt Fuji (3776m or 12,389 feet high). Japan has many earthquakes, in fact there are about 1500 of these every year.<ref name='CIA Factbook' /> The most recent big earthquake was in 2011 - called '2011 Tohoku Earthquake'. It caused great damage to several power plants forcing Japan to shut down all its nuclear plants. There was nuclear core meltdown which caused a serious health risk to nearby villages and cities.

90% of the people living in Japan live in just 10% of the [[land]], near the coast. The other 10% of the people in Japan live away from the coast.

Over 10 cities have more than a million people in them. The biggest city in Japan is [[Tokyo]], which is the capital.
[[File:Skyscrapers of Shinjuku 2009 January.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tokyo]]]]

==Politics and Government==
{{further|Government of Japan}}
The ruling party is the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)]] and prime minister is [[Shinzo Abe]].

==Science and technology==
In the past, the Japanese learned science by way of China or from [[Europe]] in the [[Meiji Era]]. However, in recent decades Japan has been a leading innovator in several fields, including [[chemical engineering]], [[nanotechnology]], and robotics. There are many technological companies in Japan, and these companies make products for export.

The robot Asimo was made and introduced in 2000. It was manufactured by [[Honda]].

==Society and culture==

{{see also|Japanese tea ceremony|Noh|Kabuki}}

Many things in Japanese culture originated in [[China]], like [[Go]] and [[bonsai]].

Japan's traditional food is [[seafood]], rice, [[miso soup]], and vegetables. [[Noodles]] and [[tofu]] are also common. [[Sushi]], a Japanese food made of cooked rice with [[vinegar]] with other ingredients such as raw fish, is popular around the world.

The religion in Japan is mostly [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhist]]. Due to the tolerant nature of the two main Japanese religions, and the resulting intermixing mixing of the two, many Japanese identify as both Shinto and Buddhist at the same time. There are small numbers of [[Christian]]s and [[Muslim]]s, and a few [[Jew]]s.

===Territorial problem===
Since Japan is an island nation, Japan has several problems over territory because maritime boundaries can be hard to protect. These days, Japan is competing for at least 4 different territories. It cannot agree with some neighbouring countries on whether the land belongs to Japan or the other country. 
* [[Senkaku Islands]] problem (with [[China]] and [[Taiwan]])
* [[Liancourt Rocks]] island problem (with [[South Korea]])
* Southern [[Chishima Islands]] problem (with [[Russia]])
* [[Sea of Japan]] problem (with [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]])

==Public transportation==
[[File:JR Central Shinkansen 700.jpg|thumb|left|High speed [[Shinkansen]] or ''Bullet trains'' are a common form of transportation in Japan.]]

There are several important international airports in Japan. [[Narita]] is the major international airport in the Tokyo area. Kansai International Airport serves as the main airport for [[Osaka]], [[Kobe]], and [[Kyoto]]. [[Chūbu Centrair International Airport]] near [[Nagoya]] is the newest of the three. [[Haneda Airport]] is close to central Tokyo and is the largest domestic airport in the country.

The [[Shinkansen]] is one of the fastest trains in the world and connects cities in Honshu and Kyushu. Networks of public and private railways are almost all over the country. People mostly travel between cities in buses.

[[Category:Japan| ]]
[[Category:Current monarchies]]
[[Category:G8 nations]]'''Jargon''' is a special way to use words that are shared only by a certain group of people.  They do not mean what the [[dictionary]] says they mean.  They have different [[meaning]]s to the people using them than their everyday meaning.

For example, the ordinary words ''boot'', ''net'', and ''web'' also have special meanings for users of [[computer]]s, the [[Internet]], and the [[World Wide Web]].  These, and to [[flame]], to [[ping]] and many [[acronym]]s are part of [[Internet slang|net jargon]].

An ''acronym'' means that only some of the letters in the word or phrase are used.  Often this is the first letter of each word. Other acronyms found online are simply common shorthand. See [[list of slang words]].

Usually, more jargon is [[create]]d over time.

Jargon is also common in the [[military]]. It includes [[phrase]]s like [[SNAFU]].

Jargon can be used by a [[clique]] to prevent others from joining or understanding, but it also is often just used because it is shorter.

Jupiter has at least 67 [[Satellite (natural)|moons]]. Of these, 55 are very small and less than five [[Kilometre|kilometres]] wide. The four largest [[moons of Jupiter]] are [[Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], and [[Callisto]]. They are collectively called the [[Galilean moons]], because they were discovered by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[astronomer]] [[Galileo Galilei]]. Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System. It is larger in diameter even than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].

== Structure ==
Jupiter is the biggest planet in the Solar System with a [[wikt:diameter|diameter]] of 142,984&nbsp;[[km]]. This is eleven times bigger than the diameter of Earth.<ref name=coffey>{{cite web |url= http://www.universetoday.com/22710/jupiter-compared-to-earth/ |title=Jupiter Compared to Earth |first=Jerry |last=Coffey |work=universetoday.com |year=December 22, 2008|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}</ref>

=== Atmosphere ===
The [[atmosphere]] near the [[wikt:surface|surface]] of Jupiter is made of about 88 to 92% [[hydrogen]], 8 to 12% [[helium]], and 1% other gases.<ref name=fact /> 

Further into the planet it is so hot and the [[pressure]] so high that helium [[condensation|becomes a liquid]] and [[precipitation|precipitates]] or [[rain]]s further down into the planet.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090410221648/http://ael.gsfc.nasa.gov/jupiterHighlights.shtml |title=Highlights of the Galileo Probe Mass Spectrometer Investigation |accessdate=2013-08-23 |format= |work= }}</ref> Based on [[spectroscopy]], Jupiter seems to be made of similar gases to [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]. It is not as similar to [[Neptune (planet)|Neptune]] or [[Uranus (planet)|Uranus]]. These two planets have much less hydrogen and helium gas.<ref>{{cite web

The very high [[temperature]]s and [[pressure]]s in Jupiter's core mean [[scientist]]s cannot tell what [[material]]s would be there. This cannot be found out, because it is not possible to create the same amount of pressure on Earth. 

Above the unknown inner core is an outer core. The outer core of Jupiter is thick, liquid [[hydrogen]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.universetoday.com/14470/does-jupiter-have-a-solid-core/ |title=Does Jupiter Have a Solid Core? |first=Jerry|last=Coffey |work=universetoday.com |year=May 22, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2015}}</ref> The pressure is high enough to make the hydrogen [[solid]], but then it [[melting|melts]] because of the heat.

=== Mass ===
Jupiter is twice as [[mass]]ive as all the other planets in the Solar System put together.<ref name=hamilton/> It gives off more [[heat]] than it gets from the [[sun]].<ref>{{cite book
  | first=Linda T. | last=Elkins-Tanton | year=2006
  | title=Jupiter and Saturn | publisher=Chelsea House
  | location=New York }}</ref>
Jupiter is 11 times the width of Earth and 318 times as massive. The [[volume]] of Jupiter is 1,317 times the volume of Earth. In other words, 1,317 Earth-sized objects could fit inside it.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/SEH/jupiter.html|title=Jupiter|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2009-07-20}}</ref>

=== Cloud layers ===
Jupiter has many bands of [[cloud]]s going [[wikt:horizontal|horizontally]] across its surface. The light parts are called zones and the darker are called belts. The zones and belts often [[wikt:interaction|interact]] with each other. This causes huge [[storm]]s. [[Wind]] speeds of 360&nbsp;[[kilometres per hour]] (km/h) are common on Jupiter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~showman/publications/ingersolletal-2004.pdf |title=Dynamics of Jupiter's atmosphere |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=The University of Arizona}}</ref> To show the difference the strongest [[tropical storm]]s on Earth are about 100&nbsp;km/h.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.weathersa.co.za/References/Cyclones.jsp|title=Tropical cyclones|publisher=Weather South Africa|accessdate=2009-07-19|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/652Gwj0pZ|archivedate=2011-01-28}}</ref>

Most of the clouds on Jupiter are made of [[ammonia]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.solarviews.com/eng/jupiter.htm|title=Jupiter|accessdate=2009-07-20|publisher=Solar View}}</ref> There may also be clouds of [[water vapour]] similar to clouds on Earth. [[Spacecraft]]s such as [[Voyager 1]] have seen [[lightning]] on the surface of the planet. Scientists think it was water vapour because lightning needs water vapour.<ref name=nasagal /> These lightning bolts have been measured as up 1,000 times as powerful as those on Earth.<ref name=nasagal>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/galileo_end.html |title=Surprising Jupiter - Busy Galileo spacecraft showed jovian system is full of surprises |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=NASA}}</ref>
The [[brown]] and [[orange]] colours are caused when sunlight passes through or [[refraction|refracts]] with the many gases in the [[atmosphere]].

=== Great Red Spot ===
One of the biggest features in Jupiter's [[atmosphere]] is the [[Great Red Spot]]. It is a huge [[storm]] which is bigger than the entire [[Earth]]. It has been known about for just under 200 years and possibly even longer.<ref>{{cite journal

=== Magnetic field ===
Jupiter has a [[magnetic field]] similar to Earth's but 11 times stronger.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/jupiter/magnetic.html|title=The Magnetic Field of Jupiter|publisher=AstroWiki|accessdate=2009-07-21}}</ref> It also has what is known as a ''[[magnetosphere]]''. The strength of the field is enough to be a serious danger to any [[spacecraft]] travelling past or to Jupiter. The magnetic field is probably caused by the large amounts of liquid [[metal]]lic [[hydrogen]] in the core of Jupiter.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://cseligman.com/text/planets/metallichydrogen.htm |title=Planetary Magnetic Fields and Metallic Hydrogen |first=Courtney |last=Seligman |work=cseligman.com |year=2014 |accessdate=April 1, 2015}}</ref> The four largest moons of Jupiter [[orbit]] or go around the planet within the magnetic field. This protects them from the [[solar wind]]. Jupiter's magnetic field is so large, it reaches the orbit of [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]] 7.7 million [[miles]] away.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astrophysicsspectator.com/topics/planets/JupiterMagnetosphere.html |title=Jupiter's Magnetosphere |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |work= |publisher=Astrophysics Spectator}}</ref> The [[Earth]]'s magnetosphere does not even cover its [[moon]], less than a quarter of a million miles away.
==== Ring system ====
{{main article|Rings of Jupiter}}
Jupiter also has a thin [[planetary ring]] system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/316306main_JunoFactSheet_2009sm.pdf|format=PDF|page=2|title=Juno Mission to Jupiter|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2011-07-21}}</ref> These rings are very difficult to see, and so they were not discovered until [[NASA]]'s [[Voyager 1]] probe went to Jupiter in 1979.<ref name=nsse/> There are four parts to Jupiter's rings. The closest ring to Jupiter is called the Halo Ring.<ref name="roj">{{cite web |url= http://www.windows2universe.org/jupiter/rings.html&edu=high |title=The Rings of Jupiter - Halo, Main and Gossamer RIng - Composition |first=Randy |last=Russell |work=windows2universe.org |year=2012|accessdate=2012-01-24}}</ref> The next ring is called the Main Ring. It is about {{convert|6440|km|mi|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} wide and only {{convert|30|km|mi|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name="roj"/> The Main and Halo rings of Jupiter are made of small, dark particles.<ref name=nsse>{{cite web|url=http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Jupiter&Display=OverviewLong|title=NASA: Solar System Exploration: Planets: Jupiter:  Read More|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2011-04-24}}</ref>  The third and fourth rings, called the ''Gossamer'' Rings, are [[transparent]] (see through) and are made from [[microscopic]] debris and dust.<ref name=nsse/> This dust probably comes from small meteors striking the surface of Jupiter's moons. The third ring is called the Amalthea Gossamer Ring, named after moon [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]]. The outer ring, the Thebe Gossamer Ring, is named after the moon [[Thebe (moon)|Thebe]]. The outer edge of this ring is about {{convert|220000|km|mi|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} from Jupiter.<ref name="roj"/>

== Orbit ==
The [[orbit]] of a planet is the time and path it takes to go around the [[Sun]]. In the amount of time it takes for Jupiter to orbit the Sun one time, the Earth orbits the Sun 11.86 times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~soper/Orbits/jupiterorbit.html |title=Jupiter's path in the sky |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=The Electronic Universe}}</ref> One [[year]] on Jupiter is equal to 11.86 years on Earth. The [[wikt:average|average]] distance between Jupiter and the Sun is 778 million [[kilometre]]s. This is five times the distance between [[Earth]] and the Sun. Jupiter is not tilted on its [[Cartesian coordinate system|axis]] as much as the Earth or [[Mars]]. This causes it to have no seasons, for example [[Summer]] or [[Winter]]. Jupiter rotates, or spins around very quickly.<ref name=cain>{{cite web |url= http://www.universetoday.com/23914/rotation-of-jupiter/ |title=Rotation of Jupiter |first=Fraser |last=Cain |work=universetoday.com |year=January 20, 2009|accessdate=April 1, 2015}}</ref> This causes the planet to [[wikt:bulge|bulge]] in the middle. Jupiter is the fastest spinning planet in the Solar System.<ref name=cain/> It completes one rotation or spin in 10 hours.<ref name=what /> Because of the bulge, the length of the [[equator]] of Jupiter is much longer than the length from [[Geographical pole|pole]] to pole.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cosmos/view_chapter.asp?id=9&page=3 |title=Jupiter: a giant primitive planet |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=NASA's Cosmos }}</ref>

== Research and exploration ==
=== From Earth ===
Jupiter is the third brightest object in the night sky, after [[the Moon]] and [[Venus]].<ref name="unaidedeye"/> Because of that, people have always been able to see it from Earth. The first person known to really study the planet was [[Galileo Galilei]] in 1610.<ref name=Galileo /> He was the first person to see Jupiter's [[Natural satellite|moons]] [[Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede]] and [[Callisto]].<ref name=Galileo>{{citeweb|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/ganymede/discovery.html|title=Jupiter|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref> This was because he used a [[telescope]], unlike anyone before him.

No new moons were discovered for more than two hundred years. In 1892, [[astronomer]] [[E.E Barnard]] found a new moon using his [[observatory]] in [[California]]. He called the moon [[Amalthea]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phys-astro.sonoma.edu/BruceMedalists/Barnard/ |title=Edward Emerson Barnard |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=The Bruce Medalists }}</ref> It was the last of Jupiter's 67 moons to be discovered by [[human]] observation through a [[telescope]].<ref name=Galileo />
In 1994, bits of the [[comet]] [[Shoemaker Levy-9]] hit Jupiter. It was the first time a collision or crash between two [[Solar System]] objects had been directly seen by [[humans|people]].<ref name="Shoemaker-Levy">{{cite web |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/sl9/ |title=Comet Shoemaker-Levy Collision with Jupiter |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=NASA }}</ref>

=== From spacecraft ===
Seven [[spacecraft]] have flown past Jupiter since 1973.<ref name=what /> These were [[Pioneer 10]] (1973), [[Pioneer 11]] (1974), Voyagers [[Voyager 1|1]] and [[Voyager 2|2]] (1979), [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] (1992 and 2004), [[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]] (2000) and [[New Horizons]] (2007).

The Pioneer missions were the first spacecraft to take close up pictures of Jupiter and its moons. Five years later, the two Voyager spacecraft discovered over 20 new moons. They captured [[Photography|photo]] [[evidence]] of [[lightning]] on the night side of Jupiter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981JGR....86.8713G |title=The helium abundance of Jupiter from Voyager |accessdate=2009-07-20 |publisher=Harvard University |work= }}</ref>

The [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] probe was sent to study the [[Sun]]. It only went to Jupiter after it had finished its main mission. Ulysses had no [[camera]]s so it took no photographs.
In 2006, the Cassini spacecraft, on its way to [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]], took some very good, very clear pictures of the planet. Cassini also found a moon and took a picture of it but it was too far away to show the details.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004Icar..172....1H |title=The Cassini-Huygens flyby of Jupiter |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=Harvard University }}</ref>

The Galileo mission in 1995 was the first spacecraft to go into [[orbit]] around Jupiter. It flew around the planet for seven years and studied all of the four biggest moons. It launched a probe into the planet to get [[information]] about Jupiter's atmosphere. The probe travelled to a depth of about 150&nbsp;km before it was crushed by the weight of all the [[gas]] above it.<ref name=Gal2>{{cite web |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/ |title=Galileo End of Mission Status |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=NASA }}</ref> This is called [[pressure]]. The Galileo spacecraft was also crushed in 2003 when [[NASA]] [[steer]]ed the craft into the planet on purpose. They did this so that the craft could not crash into [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], a [[Satellite (natural)|moon]] which [[scientist]]s think might have [[life]].<ref name=Gal2 />

[[NASA]] have sent another spacecraft to Jupiter called [[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]]. It was launched on  August 5, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/launch/index.html|title=Juno Launch|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2011-07-05|first=Tony|last=Greicius|date=2011-05-24}}</ref> The spacecraft arrived at Jupiter on July 4, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasas-juno-spacecraft-in-orbit-around-mighty-jupiter|title=NASA's Juno Spacecraft in Orbit Around Mighty Jupiter|publisher=NASA|date=2016-07-05|accessdate=2016-07-22}}</ref> Several missions have been planned to send spacecraft to Jupiter's [[Satellite (natural)|moons]] [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Callisto]].

== Moons ==
{{main|Moons of Jupiter}}

Jupiter has 67 known moons.<ref name=fact /> The four largest were seen by [[Galileo]] with his primitive telescope, and nine more can be seen from Earth with modern telescopes. The rest of the moons have been identified by spacecraft.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/append7.html#JovianSystem|title=Jovian System|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref> The smallest moon ([[S/2003 J 12]]) is only one [[kilometre]] across. The largest, [[Ganymede]], has a diameter of 5,262 kilometres. It is bigger than the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nineplanets.org/ganymede.html |title=Ganymede |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=Nine Planets }}</ref> The other three Galilean moons are [[Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Callisto]]. Because of the way they orbit Jupiter, [[gravity]] affects three of these moons greatly. The [[friction]] caused by the gravity of Europa and Ganymede pulling on Io makes it the most [[volcanoes|volcanic]] object in the Solar System. It has over 400 volcanoes, more than three times as many as [[Earth]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004Icar..169..140L |title=Lava lakes on Io: observations of Io's volcanic activity from Galileo NIMS during the 2001 fly-bys |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=Harvard University }}</ref>

[[File:InnerSolarSystem-en.png|thumb|A diagram of the inner Solar System. It shows the two groups of [[Trojan asteroid]]s that follow Jupiter in its orbit]]
Jupiter's large gravity has had a big effect on the [[Solar System]]. Jupiter protects the inner planets from [[comet]]s by pulling them towards itself. Because of this, Jupiter has the most comet impacts in the Solar System.<ref name="Shoemaker-Levy"/>

Two groups of [[asteroid]]s, called [[Trojan asteroid]]s, have settled into Jupiter's orbit round the Sun. One group is called the ''Trojans'' and the other group is called the ''Greeks''.

[[Category:Very good articles]][[File:Sceptre and Orb and Imperial Crown of Austria.jpg|right|thumb|A [[crown]] and [[scepter]] are symbols of the power of a king]]
A '''king''' is a [[man]] who rules a [[country]], because of [[inheritance]]. A king usually comes to power when the previous [[monarch]] dies, who is usually a family member of his. Sometimes a person may become king due to the previous monarch's [[abdication]], for example [[George VI]]. For most of history, most countries were ruled in this way, especially in Europe. Some countries, such as France, are no longer monarchies. Some, such as the [[United Kingdom]], still have a [[royal family]]. In some countries, people chose a new king from other people to decide from. 

The wife of a king is called a [[queen]]. A woman who becomes a ruler because of inheritance is also called a queen.

If a country has a king or a queen, that means it is a [[monarchy]]. A country which a king or queen rules is called a kingdom.

[[Category:Kings and queens| ]]'''Knowledge''' means the things which are [[true]], as opposed to [[opinion]]. [[Information]] which is correct is knowledge. Knowledge can always be supported by [[evidence]], because that is how the word is used. If a statement is not supported by evidence, then it is not knowledge. The evidence makes it justified; it is not an opinion or a guess.

Knowledge can refer to a theoretical or practical understanding of a subject. This was the point of Ryle's distinction between "knowing that" and "knowing how".<ref>Ryle, Gilbert 1949. ''The concept of mind''. London: Hutchinson, Chapter 2 Knowing how and knowing that.</ref>  It can be implicit (as with practical skill or expertise) or explicit (as with the theoretical understanding of a subject); it can be more or less formal or systematic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_us1261368#m_en_us1261368|title=knowledge: definition of knowledge in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}</ref> In [[philosophy]], the study of knowledge is called [[epistemology]]. The philosopher [[Plato]] defined knowledge as "justified true belief". This definition is the subject of the [[Gettier problems]]. 

All knowledge is a claim to be true, but the claim can be incorrect. The only claims ([[proposition]]s) which are certainly true are circular, based on how we use words or terms. We can correctly claim that there are 360 degrees in a circle, since that is part of how circles are defined. The point of Aristotle's [[syllogism]] was to show that this kind of reasoning had a machine-like form:
*If all swans are white, and this is a swan, then it must be white. 
But actually, in the real world, not all swans are white.

The most widely accepted way to find reliable knowledge is the [[scientific method]]. Yet one thing all [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]]  agree is that there is that scientific knowledge is just the best we can do at any one time. All scientific knowledge is provisional, not a claim of absolute truth.

==Religion and knowledge ==
Knowledge in religion is different in that it depends on [[faith]], [[belief]] and the [[authority]] of religious leaders, not on evidence of a scientific or legal kind. There are differing views on whether religious statements should be regarded as knowledge.

In many expressions of [[Christianity]], such as [[Catholicism]] and [[Anglicanism]], knowledge is one of the seven gifts of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a7.htm#1831|title=Part Three, No. 1831|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church|accessdate=2007-04-20}}</ref>
In the [[Garden of Eden]] knowledge is the factor that made humans greedy and treacherous. But in the [[Book of Proverbs]] it states: 'to be wise you must first obey the LORD' (9:10)

In Islam, knowledge has great significance. "The All-Knowing" (''al-ʿAlīm'') is one of the Names of God, reflecting distinct properties of God in Islam. The [[Qur'an]] asserts that knowledge comes from God ({{cite quran|2|239|style=nosup|expand=no}}) and various ''[[hadith]]'' encourage getting knowledge. [[Muhammad]] is reported to have said "Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave" and "Verily the men of knowledge are the inheritors of the prophets". Islamic scholars, theologians and jurists are often given the title ''alim'', meaning 'knowledgeable'.

'''Kauai''' ('''Kaua'i''' in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]) is the oldest and fourth largest of the main [[Hawaiian Islands]], in the [[United States]]. Known also as the "Garden Isle", Kaua'i lies 105 miles (170 kilometers) across the Kaua'i Channel, northwest of [[Honolulu]] on [[Oahu|O'ahu]]. It is of [[volcano|volcanic]] origin. The highest point is [[Mount Waialeale]], at the center of the island, 5,148 feet (1,570 meters) above sea level. The wettest spot on Earth, with average rainfall of 460 inches (11,648 millimeters) a year, is just east of Mount Waialeale. The high yearly rainfall has eroded deep valleys in the central mountain. It has made canyons with many scenic waterfalls.

The city of [[Lihue, Hawaii|Lihue]], on the island's southeast side, is the seat of [[Kauai County, Hawaii|Kauai County]]. It is the main city on the island. [[Waimea, Hawaii|Waimea]], on the island's southwest side and once the capital of Kauai, was the first place visited by explorer Captain [[James Cook]] in [[1778]]. The city is at the head of one of the most beautiful canyons in the world, [[Waimea Canyon]], whose gorge is 900 meters (3,000 feet) deep.

The island of Kauai was featured in Disney's [[2002]] [[animated feature film]] ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]''.

[[Category:Islands of Hawaii]]{{complex|date=February 2012}}

'''Kaho{{okina}}olawe''' is the smallest of the 8 main [[volcano|volcanic]] islands in the [[Hawaiian Islands]], in the [[United States]].  It is west of [[Maui]] and south of [[Lanai|Lana{{okina}}i]] and is 11 miles long by {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} across ({{convert|45|sqmi|km2|disp=or|abbr=on}}). The highest point, Lua Makika, is {{convert|1477|ft|m}} above sea level. The island is rather dry because its low height does not cause much [[rain]] ([[orographic precipitation]]) to fall from the northeastern [[trade winds]].

Kaho{{okina}}olawe was used as a gunfire and bombing target by the United States [[military]] because of [[World War II]], and a defense training area by the [[United States Navy]] from around 1941 until May 1994.  Popular feeling in Hawai{{okina}}i against this practice finally won, and the Navy has been trying to finish a cleanup of unexploded ordnance (bombs and explosive shells) from the island.  Ordnance is still buried or lying on the ground. Other items have washed down gullies and still other unexploded ordnance is underwater offshore. In 1981, the entire island was included on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The island is planned to be given back to the Hawaiian people.  In 1993, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed a law that "recognized the cultural importance of the island, required the Navy to return the island to the State, and directed the Navy to do an unexploded ordnance (UXO) cleanup and environmental restoration" [http://www.state.hi.us/kirc/main/home.htm]. The turnover officially occurred on [[November 11]], [[2003]], but the cleanup has not yet been completed. The U.S. Navy was given $400 million and 10 years to complete the large cleanup task, but this work has gone much slower than planned.

In 1993, the [[Hawaii]] State [[Legislature]] established the Kaho{{okina}}olawe Island Reserve. It is made up of the whole island and waters out to {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} from shore. By State Law, Kaho{{okina}}olawe and its waters can only be used for Native Hawaiian [[cultural]], [[spiritual]], and [[subsistence]] purposes; fishing; [[environmental restoration]]; [[historic preservation]]; and [[education]]. Commercial uses are not allowed. The Legislature also created the Kaho{{okina}}olawe Island Reserve Commission (KIRC) to manage the Reserve while it is held in trust for a "future Native Hawaiian Sovereignty entity" [http://www.state.hi.us/kirc/main/home.htm]. 

After the cleanup is finished, the restoration of Kaho{{okina}}olawe will need ways to control [[erosion]], restore the plant life, recharge the [[water table]], and slowly replace alien plants with native ones. Plans will include methods for damming gullies and reducing rainwater runoff. Non-natives will temporarily stabilize some areas before the permanent planting of native plants.

[[Category:Volcanoes of Hawaii]]The act of '''killing''' a [[life form|living thing]] can be said to have happened when an outside [[force]], usually another life form, has done something to cause it to [[death|die]].

When a [[human being]] is killed by another human being, this event is called a [[homicide]], [[manslaughter]], [[hero]]ism in time of [[war]], or [[abortion]]. When a human being chooses to be killed by their own actions, it is called a [[suicide]].

A kill is also the act of shooting down a [[fighter aircraft]].
The word kill is very serious; it means that someone might soon meet their death if they are not careful. People who kill others are called [[murderers]]. 

When a [[soldier]] kills another in [[war]], it is called "[[combat]]".  When the [[state]] kills a criminal, it is called [[Capital punishment]]. When someone kills a [[politician]] it is called [[assassination]]. When a person who wants to die is killed by another, it is called [[euthanasia]]. When people watch people killing each other on [[television]], it is called [[crime fiction|crime drama]] or [[entertainment]]. When people kill other people to eat them, it is called [[cannibalism]].

[[Category:Crime]][[File:Sunraysia hwy.jpg|thumb|right|Distance to towns shown in kilometres on an Australian road]]
The '''kilometre''' is a common [[Unit of measurement|unit]] used for longer [[distance]]s on [[Earth]]. The [[SI|international unit]] for measuring distances is the [[metre]] and a kilometre is 1000 metres. It is used in some countries for measuring road and sea distances. In the [[UK]] and the [[USA]], the [[mile]] is used more than kilometres for road distances and the [[nautical mile]] for sea distances.

It is often used to measure the speed of cars, planes and boats by saying how many kilometres it can travel in an hour. This is shown as km/h.

It is also spelled '''kilometer'''. This spelling is used in [[American English]].

One kilometre is 0.6214 miles (3280.84 feet). This means that one mile is 1.6093 kilometres.

One kilometre is the approximate distance a healthy adult human being can walk in ten [[minute]]s.

[[Category:Units of length]]'''Language''' is the normal way [[human]]s [[communication|communicate]].<ref name="Oxford">''Concise Oxford dictionary''. p764</ref> Only [[human]]s use language, though many other animals communicate in various ways. 

Human language has [[syntax]], a set of [[rule]]s for connecting [[word]]s together to make [[Proposition|statements]] and [[question|questions]]. Language can also be changed, by adding new words, for example, to describe new things. Other animals may inherit a set of calls which have pre-set functions. 

Language may be done by [[speech]] or by [[writing]] or by moving the hands to make [[Sign language|signs]]. It follows that language is ''not'' just any way of communicating. Even some human communication is not language: see [[non-verbal communication]]. Humans also use language for [[thought|thinking]].

Language is a word that may be used by extension: 
# The language of a [[community]] or [[country]].
# The faculty of [[speech]].
# [[Formal language]] in [[mathematics]], [[logic]] and [[computing]].
# [[Sign language]] for deaf people (people who cannot hear).
# A type of [[school]] subject.

[[UNESCO]] says that 2,500 languages are at risk of becoming [[extinction|extinct]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/guide/languages.shtml | title=BBC Languages | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate=February 04, 2012}}</ref>

== Universals of language ==
All languages share certain things which separate them from all other kinds of communication.<ref>Scalise, Sergio; Magni, Elisabetta; Bisetto, Antonietta (eds) 2009. ''Universals of language today''. Studies in Natural Language and Linguistic Theory, vol 76. Springer Verlag.</ref><ref name="Chao">Yuan Ren Chao 1968. ''Language and symbolic systems''. Cambridge.</ref>
#A language has rules which are shared by a community.
#All human languages are based on [[sound]] and [[hearing]], or in the case of [[sign language]], [[Sight|vision]]. All the basic sound units, or [[phoneme]]s, have this in common: they can be spoken by the human [[voice]], and heard by the human [[ear]].
#The sounds come out in a [[sequence]], not all at once. This is mimicked in writing, where the marks are put on the paper or screen in the same sequence.
#The stream of sounds have little gaps between them, and come in bigger packages. We call the bigger packets [[sentence]]s or [[question]]s or replies or comments.
#In most languages, [[English language|English]] being one, the [[syntax]] or order of the words can change the meaning: "the cat sat on the man" is different from "the man sat on the cat".
#[[Word]]s (which may be made up of more than one phoneme) divide up into two classes: content and non-content. Content words have [[semantics|meaning]]: nouns, verbs &c. Non-content words are there to make the language work: ''and'', ''not'', ''in'', ''out'', ''what'', &c. [[Grammar]] consists of studying how words fit together to mean something.
#All languages have:
## sentences with two types of expression: [[noun]]s and [[verb]]s: ''Jill is'' here.
## [[adjective]]s to modify nouns: ''good'' food.
## ways of linking: sink ''or'' swim.
## dummy elements: Jill likes to swim, ''so'' do I.
## devices to order or ask questions: Get up! Are you ill?
# Most of the languages have a [[writing system|written form]]. Before the invention of audio recording, the writing system was the only way to keep track of spoken information.
# All languages constantly evolve. New words appear, new form of saying things, new accentuations.
There are many more things in common between languages.<ref>Greenberg J.H. (ed) 1966. ''Universals of language''. 2nd ed, MIT Press.</ref>

=== Inheritance ===
The capacity to learn and use language is [[Heredity|inherited]]. Normally, all humans are born with this capability. ''Which'' language is learned by a child depends on which language is spoken by the child's community. The ''capacity'' is inherited, but the particular language is learned.

Children have a special period, from about 18 months to about four years, which is critical for learning the language. If this is seriously disrupted, then their language skills will be damaged.  Older people learn differently, so they seldom learn a [[second language]] as well as they learn their native language.

==Types of language ==
[[Mathematics]] and [[computer science]] use created languages called [[formal language]]s (like computer [[programming language]]s), but these may or may not be 'true' languages. Mathematics itself is seen as a language by many. Some people consider musical notation to be a way of writing the musical language.

[[Chinese language|Chinese]] is the language with the most native speakers in the world, but Chinese is not really a language. It is a close family of [[Dialect|dialects]], some of which are as different as [[Romance languages]] are from one another.

English is often called "the international language",or the world's [[lingua franca]]. It is the main second language of the world and the international language of [[science]], [[travel]], [[technology]], [[business]], [[diplomacy]], and [[entertainment]].

:* '''Chinese''' (Mandarin): 390 million native speakers.<ref name="Chao"/><sup>p96</sup><ref>850 million claimed by English Wikipedia ([[Chinese language]]) but without specific reference.</ref>
Some languages are made up so that a lot of people around the world can learn them, without the new languages being tied to any specific country or place. These are called [[Constructed language|constructed languages]]. One of the most popular of these languages is [[Esperanto]], which is sometimes called "La Internacia Lingvo," or "The International Language." Another of these languages is called [[Volapuk]], which was popular about a hundred years ago but is much less popular now. It has mostly been replaced by languages like [[Esperanto]], [[Interlingua]], and [[Ido]].

Part of the reason that [[Volapuk]] became unpopular is that some sounds are hard to say for people who speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or English, two of the most widely spoken languages in the world.

'''Leisure''' (or '''free time''') is when a person can choose what to do. During a person's leisure time, they do not have an obligation to be at [[school]] or work at a [[job]]. During leisure time, people can do [[wikt:fun|fun]] activities, [[family]] activities, or other non-[[Labour (economics)|work]] activity, such as hobbies.  

Common forms of recreation or leisure are:

* Playing [[sport]]s such as [[football]] or [[ice hockey|hockey]]
* Playing [[game]]s such as chess or cards
* Exercising such as running or lifting weights
* Watching [[television]] and [[movies]]
* Listening to [[music]]
*[[Hobby|Hobbies]] such as playing [[piano]] or [[guitar]], knitting, or sewing
*[[Travel]]ling
* Reading
* [[Book Club]]s

A vacation or [[holiday]] is the setting aside of time specifically for leisure. During their vacation, some people travel to a different region or country, and stay at a [[hotel]] so that they can do things they could not do near home. Other people prefer to spend their vacation time at home in their own community.

In rich [[developed nations|industrialized countries]] such as the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]], as well as in most European countries, workers are allowed to stay home on the [[weekend]] (usually [[Saturday]] and [[Sunday]]), and use it as leisure time. People in poorer developing countries usually have less leisure time, as they have to work longer hours and more days per year.

*"I live in a house". 
*"A person can always live in fear". 

'''Live''' can be an [[adjective]]. It rhymes with "five".
*In [[television]], a "live" [[Television programme|program]] is one where what is happening can be seen at the same time as it is happening. [[Sports]] program are usually "live".

[[File:HumanNewborn.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A newborn [[baby]] is an example of [[life]]]]

'''Life''' is a [[biological]] concept regarding the characteristic, state, or mode that separates a living thing from [[dead]] matter. 

The word itself may refer to a living being or ongoing processes of which living things are a part of. It may also refer to the period during which something is functional (as between birth and death), the condition of an entity that has been born but yet has to die or that which makes a living thing alive. 

The study of life is called [[biology]] and people who study life are biologists. A lifespan is the [[average]] length of life in a species. All known life on [[Earth]] is powered by solar energy. Without energy from the sun no life could exist. All life on Earth is based on the [[chemistry]] of [[carbon]] compounds, specifically involving long-chain molecules such as [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]. With [[water]], which is essential, the long molecules are wrapped inside [[Cell membrane|membranes]] to form [[cell]]s. This may or may not be true of all possible forms of life in the [[Universe]]: it is true of all life on Earth today.

==Summary==
Living organisms are [[Systems theory|open systems]]. They are always changing, because they exchange [[material]]s and [[information]] with their [[environment]]. They undergo [[metabolism]], maintain [[homeostasis]], possess a capacity to [[cell growth|grow]], respond to [[stimulus|stimuli]] and [[Reproduction|reproduce]].

Through [[natural selection]], they adapt to their environment in successive generations.

== Definitions of life ==
One explanation of life is called the [[cell theory]]. The cell theory has three basic points: all living things are made up of cells. The cell is the smallest living thing that can do all the things needed for life. All cells must come from pre-existing cells.

Something is often said to be alive if it:
* grows,
* takes in [[food]], uses the [[food]] for [[energy]], and passes [[waste]] products (see [[metabolism]]),
* [[Motion (physics)|moves]]: it must either move itself, or have movement inside itself,
* [[Reproduction|reproduces]], either [[sexual reproduction|sexually]] (with another living thing) or [[asexual reproduction|asexually]], by creating [[wikt:copy|copies]] of itself,
* [[wikt:reaction|reacts]] to its surroundings,
* [[wikt:function|functions]], and
* continues to [[existence|exist]].

However, not all living things fit every point on this list. 
* [[mule|Mules]] cannot reproduce, and neither can worker ants.
* [[virus (biology)|Viruses]] and spores are not actively alive (metabolising) until the conditions are right.

They do, however, fit the biochemical definitions: they are made of the same kind of chemicals.

The [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] definition of life is any system which can keep its [[Thermodynamic entropy|entropy]] levels below maximum (usually through [[adaptation]] and [[mutation|mutations]]).

=== A modern approach ===
A modern definition was given by [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] in 1980,<ref>Maturana H. & Varela F. 1980. ''Autopoiesis and cognition: the realization of the living''. Boston: Reidel.</ref> to which they gave the name ''[[autopoiesis]]'':
#The production of their own components
#The correct assembly of these components
#Continuous repair and maintenance of their own existence.
Roth commented that "In short, organisms are self-reproducing and self-maintaining, or 'autopoietic', systems".<ref>Roth G. 2013. ''The long evolution of brains and minds''. Heidelberg: Springer. p41, 48</ref> This approach makes use of [[molecular biology]] ideas and [[systems science]] ideas.

[[Category:Life| ]]The '''law''' is a set of [[rule]]s that people are made to follow by the [[state]]. The courts and police enforce this system of rules and [[punishment|punish]] people who break the laws, such as by making them pay a [[fine]] or other [[punishment|penalty]] or sending them to jail. In ancient societies, laws were written by [[leader]]s, to set out rules on how people can live, work and do business with each other. Today in most countries, laws are written and voted on by groups of elected politicians in a [[legislature]], such as a [[parliament]] or congress. To follow the laws of a society is to do '''legal''' things. An activity is '''illegal''' if it breaks a law or does not follow the laws.

A [[legal code]] is a written code of laws that are [[law enforcement|enforce]]d. This may deal with things like [[police]], [[court]]s, or punishments. A [[lawyer]], jurist or attorney is a professional who studies and argues the rules of law. In the United States, there are two kinds of attorneys - "transactional" attorneys who write [[contracts]] and "litigators" who go to [[court]]. In the United Kingdom, these professionals are called solicitors and barristers respectively. 

The ''[[Rule of Law]]'' is the law which says that government can only legally use its power in a way the government and the people agree on. It limits the powers a [[government]] has, as agreed in a country's [[constitution]]. The ''Rule of Law'' prevents dictatorship and protects the rights of the people. When leaders enforce the legal code honestly, even on themselves and their friends, this is an example of the rule of law being followed. "The rule of law", wrote the ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] in 350 BC, "is better than the rule of any individual."

[[Culture]] is usually a major source of the principles behind many laws, as people tend to trust the ideas based on [[family]] and social habits. In many countries throughout history, [[religion]] and religious books like the [[Vedas]], [[Bible]] or the [[Koran]] have been a major source of law.

== Types of law ==
* [[Contract]] law sets rules on agreements to buy and sell items and services.
* [[Property]] law states the rights and obligations that a person has when they buy, sell, or rent homes and land (called [[real property]] or [[real property|realty]]), and objects (called [[personal property]]).
** [[Intellectual property]]  (IP) law involves the rights people have over things they create, such as art, music, and literature. This is called [[copyright]]. It also protects inventions that people make, by a kind of law called [[patent]]. It also covers the rights people have to the names of a company or a distinctive mark or logo. This is called [[trademark]].
* Trust law (business Law) sets out the rules for money that is put into an [[investment]], such as pension funds that people save up for their retirement. It involves many different types of law, including administrative and property law.
*[[Tort law]] helps people to make claims for [[money|compensation]] (repayment) when someone hurts them or hurts their property.
*[[Crime|Criminal law]] is used by the government to prevent people from breaking laws, and punish people who do break them.
*[[Constitutional law]] deals with the important rights of the government, and its relationship with the people. It mainly involves the interpretation of a [[constitution]], but also involves things like the [[Separation of powers]] of the different branches of government.
*Administrative law is used by ordinary citizens who want to challenge decisions made by governments. It also involves things like [[regulations]], and the operation of the [[administrative agencies]] that the [[president]] creates.
*[[International law]] is used to set out rules on how countries can act in areas such as trade, the environment, or military action. The [[Geneva Conventions]] on the conduct of war and the [[Roerich Pact]] are examples of international law.
*[[Custom]] and tradition are practices that are widely adopted and agreed upon in a society, thought often not in a written form. Custom and tradition can be enforced in courts and are sometimes considered as part of the legal reasoning in matters decided in courts. In some societies and cultures all law is or was custom and tradition, though this is increasingly rare although there are some parts of the world where custom tradition are still binding or even the predominant form of law, for example tribal lands or failed states.

== Civil law and common law ==
'''[[Civil law]]''' is the legal system used in most countries around the world today. Civil law is based on legislation that is found in [[constitution]]s or statutes passed by government. The secondary part of civil law is the legal approaches that are part of custom. In civil law governments, judges do not generally have much power, and most of the laws and [[legal precedent]] are created by [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]].
 
'''[[Common law]]''' is based on the decisions made by judges in past court cases. It comes from England and it became part of almost every country that once belonged to the British Empire, except [[Malta]], [[Scotland]], the U.S. state of [[Louisiana]], and the Canadian province of [[Quebec]]. It is also the predominant form of law in the United States, where many laws called [[statutes]] are written by [[Congress]], but many more legal rules exist from the decisions of the courts. Common law had its beginnings in the Middle Ages, when King John was forced by his barons to sign a document called the [[Magna Carta]].

== Religious law ==
Religious law is law based on religious beliefs or books. Examples include the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Halakha]], [[Islam]]ic [[Sharia]], and [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Canon law]]. 

Until the 1700s, Sharia law was the main legal system throughout the Muslim world. In some Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, the whole legal systems still base their law on Sharia law. Islamic law is often criticised because it often has harsh penalties for crimes. A serious criticism is the judgement of the [[European Court]] that "sharia is incompatible with the fundamental principles of [[democracy]]".<ref name=Judgement/><ref>[http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/29AC6DBD-C3F8-411C-9B97-B42BE466EE7A/0/2004__Wildhaber_Cancado_Trindade_BIL__opening_legal_year.pdf Hearing of the European Court of Human Rights], January 22, 2004 (PDF)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/Eng/Press/2001/July/RefahPartisi2001jude.htm |title=ECHR press release Refah Partisi (2001) |publisher=Echr.coe.int |date= |accessdate=2012-04-04}}</ref> 

The [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[Refah Party]]'s sharia-based "plurality of legal systems, grounded on religion" was ruled to contravene the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]]. The Court decided Refah's plan would "do away with the State's role as the guarantor of individual rights and freedoms" and "infringe the principle of non-discrimination between individuals as regards their enjoyment of public freedoms, which is one of the fundamental principles of democracy".<ref name=Judgement>[http://www.strasbourgconsortium.org/common/document.view.php?docId=3878], by Christian Moe, Norwegian Institute of Human Rights, published at the site of The Strasbourg Conference (31 pages).</ref>

== History of law ==
The history of law is closely connected to the development of human civilizations . Ancient [[Egypt]]ian law developed in 3000 BC. In 1760 BC King [[Hammurabi]], took ancient [[Babylon]]ian law and organized it, and then had it chiseled in stone for the public to see in the marketplace. These laws became known as the [[Code of Hammurabi]]. 

The [[Torah]] from the [[Old Testament]] is an old body of law. It was written around 1280 BC. It has moral rules such as the Ten Commandments, which tell people what things are not permitted.

== Legislature ==
In democracies, the people in a country usually choose people called politicians to represent them in a legislature. Examples of legislatures include the Houses of Parliament in London, the Congress in Washington, D.C., the Bundestag in Berlin, the Duma in Moscow and the Assemblée nationale in Paris. Most legislatures have two chambers or houses, a 'lower house' and an 'upper house'. To pass legislation, a majority of Members of Parliament must vote for a bill in each house. The legislature is the branch of government that writes laws, and votes on whether they will be approved.

== Judiciary ==
The [[judiciary]] is a group of [[judge]]s who resolve people's disputes and determine whether people who are charged with crimes are guilty. In some jurisdictions the judge does not find guilt or innocence but instead directs a jury, how to interpret facts from a legal perspective, but the jury determines the facts based on evidence presented to them and finds the guilt or innocences of the charged person.  Most countries of common law and civil law systems have a system of appeals courts, up to a supreme authority such as the Supreme Court or the High Court. The highest courts usually have the power to remove laws that are unconstitutional (which go against the constitution).

== Executive (government) and Head of State ==
The executive is the governing center of political authority. In most democratic countries, the executive is elected from people who are in the legislature. This group of elected people is called the cabinet. In France, the US and Russia, the executive branch has a President which exists separately from the legislature. 

The executive suggests new laws and deals with other countries. As well, the executive usually controls the military, the police, and the bureaucracy. The executive selects ministers, or secretaries of state to control departments such as the health department or the department of justice. 

In many jurisdictions the Head of State does not take part in the day to day governance of the jurisdiction and takes a largely ceremonial role. This is the case in many Commonwealth nations where the Head of State, usually a Governor almost exclusively acts "on the advice" of the head of the Executive (e.g. the Prime Minister, First Minister or Premier). The primary legal role of the Head of State in these jurisdictions is to act as a check or balance against the Executive, as the Head of State has the rarely exercised power to dissolve the legislature, call elections and dismiss ministers. 

== Other parts of the legal system ==
The '''[[police]]''' enforce the criminal laws by arresting people suspected of breaking the law. '''[[Bureaucracy|Bureaucrats]]''' are the government workers and government organizations that do work for the government. Bureaucrats work within a system of rules, and they make their decisions in writing. 

'''[[Lawyer]]s''' are people who have learned about laws. Lawyers give people advice about their legal rights and duties and represent people in [[court]]. To become a lawyer, a person has to complete a two- or three-year [[university]] program at a law school and pass an entrance examination. Lawyers work in law firms, for the government, for companies, or by themselves. 

'''Civil society''' is the people and groups that are not part of government that try to protect people against human rights abuses and try to protect freedom of speech and other individual rights. Organizations that are part of civil society include political parties, debating clubs, [[trade union]]s, human rights organizations, [[newspaper]]s and charities.

"[[Corporation]]s are among the organizations that use the legal system to further their goals.  Like the others, they use means such as [[campaign donation]]s and [[advertising]] to persuade people that they are right.  Corporations also engage in [[commerce]] and make new things such as [[automobile]]s, vaporisers/e-cigarettes, and [[Unmanned_aerial_vehicle]]s (i.e. "drones") that the old laws are not well equipped to deal with.

'''Ludovic Lazarus Zamenhof''' (December 15, 1859 &ndash; April 14, 1917) was a [[eye]] doctor, linguist, and scholar who created the international language [[Esperanto]]. 

Zamenhof was born in [[1859]] in the town of [[Białystok]], [[Poland]]. At the time, Poland was a part of the Russian Empire. Bialystok contained three major groups: Poles, Belorussians, and Yiddish-speaking [[Jew]]s. Zamenhof thought that one common language would join these groups and stop fights between them.

His first language was said to be [[Polish language|Polish]]. His parents spoke [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Yiddish]] in the home. His father was a [[German language|German]] teacher, so Zamenhof learned that language from an early age and spoke the language fluently. Later he learned [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[English language|English]]. He also had an interest in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]].

Zamenhof decided that the international language must have a simple grammar and be easier to learn than [[Volapük]], an earlier international language. He [[wikt:attempt|attempted]] to create the international language with a grammar that was [[wikt:rich|rich]], and [[wikt:complex|complex]]. The basics of Esperanto were published in [[1887]].

His grandson, [[Louis-Christophe Zaleski-Zamenhof]], has lived in [[France]] since the 1960s.

{{DEFAULTSORT:countries}}
[[Category:Lists of countries| ]][[Canada]]'s land is composed of thirteen parts: ten [[province]]s and three [[Territory|territories]].  Canada is governed on the principles of a [[federation]]: the Provinces' [[government]]s share power with the Government of Canada (the federal government). The territories' governments have a more limited set of powers versus the federal government than that of the provinces'.

[[File:Political map of Canada.png|550px|center]]

The provinces are in the south of Canada, and the territories are in the north, where fewer people live.

Here is a list of the provinces, and their standard [[abbreviation]]s, with their [[Capital (city)|capital]]s (the cities where their governments have their offices). Canada's capital city is [[Ottawa]]. 

Pacific Coast or West Coast

*BC is [[British Columbia]] (its capital is [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]])

The Prairies

*AB is [[Alberta]] (its capital is [[Edmonton]])
*SK is [[Saskatchewan]] (its capital is [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]])
*MB is [[Manitoba]] (its capital is [[Winnipeg]])

Central Canada

*ON is [[Ontario]] (its capital is [[Toronto]])
*QC is [[Quebec]] (its capital is [[Quebec City]]) (the abbreviation 'PQ' is still used in place of the more commonly accepted 'QC')

Atlantic Canada

The Maritimes

*NB is [[New Brunswick]] (its capital is [[Fredericton]])
*NS is [[Nova Scotia]] (its capital is [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]])
*PE is [[Prince Edward Island]] (its capital is [[Charlottetown]])
*NL (formerly NF) is [[Newfoundland]] and [[Labrador, Canada|Labrador]] (its capital is [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]])

The three territories are:

*YT is [[Yukon]] (its capital is [[Whitehorse]])
*NT is [[Northwest Territories]] (its capital is [[Yellowknife, Northwest Territories|Yellowknife]])
*NU is [[Nunavut]] (its capital is [[Iqaluit]]).

'''Las Vegas''' is a [[city]] in the [[United States|American]] [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Nevada]]. There were 567,641 people living in the city in 2009. It is the biggest city in Nevada. Las Vegas is also the [[county seat]] of Clark County. 

== History ==
[[Native Americans]], the Paiute tribe, first lived there. It was called ''Las Vegas'' by [[Spain|Spanish]] people. The name means ''The [[Meadow]]s'' in the [[Spanish language]]. It had a lot of these in 1854. The city is known for its dry weather, as is the rest of southern [[Nevada]]. It is surrounded by deserts.

The US Army built [[Fort Baker (Nevada)|Fort Baker]] there in 1864. Las Vegas has [[Spring (water)|springs]] so people used to stop there for water when they were going to [[Los Angeles]] or other places in [[California]].

In 1905, 110 acres owned by William A. Clark, on which he built a [[railroad]] to Southern [[California]] were [[auction]]ed and Las Vegas was founded as a railroad [[town]]. Las Vegas officially became a city in 1911.

== Culture ==
Las Vegas, is also known by a [[abbreviation|shorter name]], '''Vegas.''' The city has become well known for its lax laws for [[alcohol|drinking]] and [[gambling]]. Gambling was made legal in the state of Nevada in 1931. In 1941, many hotels were built in Las Vegas with casinos in them. Las Vegas is sometimes called "Sin City" because so many people come to the city for gambling and drinking alcohol, two common "sins". The adage is "what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas".
People come to Las Vegas for vacation, many hotels have different themes and have shows and events to get people to come there. Because of this, Las Vegas has been called "The [[Entertainment]] Capital of the World". 

Las Vegas is also well known due to the casinos (an establishment where gambling games are played) many of which are decorated with various bright [[colour]]s. Some of the most famous casinos include [[Caesars Palace]], a [[Roman Empire]] themed casino, [[Bellagio]], a [[Bellagio, Lombardy|Bellagio]], [[Italy]] themed casino, [[Paris Las Vegas]], a [[Paris]] themed casino, [[Monte Carlo Las Vegas]], a [[Monte Carlo]], [[Monaco]] themed casino, and [[New York New York]], a [[New York City]] themed casino. [[Downtown]] Las Vegas is in the city of Las Vegas, but the [[Las Vegas Strip]] is not. It is mostly in [[Paradise, Nevada]], with a smaller part in [[Winchester, Nevada]].

[[Category:County seats in Nevada]]'''Lanai''' (or '''Lānaʻi''') is sixth largest of the [[Hawaiian Islands]], in the [[United States]]. It is also known as the "Pineapple Island". The island is almost a circle in shape and is 18 miles wide in the longest direction. The land area is 140 sq. miles (367 km<sup>2</sup>). It is separated from the island of [[Moloka'i]] by the [[Kalohi Channel]] to the north.

==History==
Lana'i was first seen by Europeans on 25 February [[1779]] by Captain Clerke, with ''HMS Resolution'' on the [[James Cook]] Pacific Ocean trip. Clerke took command of the ship after Capt. Cook was killed at [[Kealakekua Bay]] on February 14, and was leaving the islands for the North Pacific. 

In [[1922]], [[James Drummond Dole|Jim Dole]], the president of [[Dole Food Company|Dole Pineapple Company]], bought the island of Lana'i. He made a large part of it into the world's largest [[pineapple]] [[plantation]]. 

==Tourism==
Tourism on Lana'i started not long ago. That was when the growing of pineapple was slowly coming to an end in the Islands. On Lana'i, you can be with nature and feel the mood of the Hawaiian countryside. Not like nearby [[Oahu|O'ahu]], the only town (Lana'i City) is small. It has no traffic or shopping centers. Tourists come mainly to relax.

There are three hotels on Lana'i and several golf courses.

[[Category:Islands of Hawaii]]A '''leap year''' is a [[year]] in which an extra [[day]] is added to the [[Gregorian calendar]], which is used by most of the world. While an ordinary year has 365 [[day]]s, a leap year has 366 days. The extra day, [[February 29]], is added to the [[month]] of [[February]]. In an ordinary year, February has 28 days, but in a leap year, it has 29 days. The extra 29th day, called a leap day, is the same day of the week as the first day of the month, [[February 1]]. Also, in a leap year, the months of [[January]], [[April]], and [[July]] all start on the same day of the week.

A leap year comes once every four years. Because of this, a leap year can always be evenly [[Division (mathematics)|divided]] by four. For example, [[2012]] was a leap year. But a year is not a leap year if it can be evenly divided by 100 but cannot also be evenly divided by 400. This is why [[1600]], [[2000]], and [[2400]] are leap years, but [[1700]], [[1800]], and [[1900]] were not.

We have leap years because instead of 365 days, the [[Earth]] really takes a few minutes less than 365-1/4 days (365.24219) to go completely around the [[Sun]]. Without leap years, the [[season]]s would start one day earlier on the calendar every four years. After 360 years, spring (which usually begins on March 21) would begin on December 21 (which is when winter presently begins).

A number of countries use a [[lunar calendar]] (based on the [[moon]], instead of the [[Sun]], like our [[solar calendar]] is). They have leap years when they add an extra lunar month. Different calendars add the extra month in different ways.

'''Leather''' is the [[skin]] of an [[animal]] used as a [[material]]. The skins of [[cow]]s, [[pig]]s, and [[goat]]s are often used to make leather. Skins of [[snake]]s, [[alligator]]s or [[crocodile]]s, and [[ostrich]]es are sometimes used to make fancier leather. [[Shoe]]s, [[bag]]s, [[clothes]], and [[ball]]s are often made of leather. Sometimes people make leather out of whales, ducks, giraffes, and African elephants, but all of these ways of making leather are very simple but can also be very hard and rare sometimes.

[[Category:Natural materials]]A '''license''' (or '''licence''') allows someone to do something that they otherwise are not allowed to do. A person usually has to pay some [[money]], and maybe pass a [[test]] to get a license. A license is usually written but it does not have to be. Most kinds of licenses can only be used by the person they were given to. Licenses may be temporary or permanent. Some licenses can not be taken away once they are given. A person with a license is called a '''licensee'''.

For example, John has a license to sell vegetables in the market for 10 years from 2010 to 2020. John grants an exclusive license to Jane to sell vegetables for 4 years from 2012 to 2016.  Here, John will be referred as ''licensor'' and Jane will be referred as ''licensee''.

In many countries, if a person tries to do something without the correct license to do it, he might have to pay a [[fine]] or go to [[prison]].

==Examples of licenses==
There are many different types of licenses.

===Driver's license===
The [[law]]s of most [[country|countries]] say that people are only allowed to drive [[car]]s if they have a [[driver's license]].  If a person does not have a license, they may have to pay a [[fine]] if they are caught by the [[police]].  In many countries, a person must take a test and pay money to get a license. The test would check that they know the road rules, and have the skill to drive a car.

===Hunting license===
Other licenses give permission to [[shoot]] [[animal]]s (often called a hunting license). The hunting license usually says when a person may hunt. A hunter may have to pass a test to show that he understands the rules about hunting.

===Television licence===
In the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]], if someones has a [[television]] set, they must buy a "television licence" every year.

=== Copyright licenses ===
Copyright is a law that gives the owner of a creative work the right to decide what other people can do with it. A [[person]] or a [[company]] can give a license to a [[copyright]] that they own. So in order for another person to use an owner's copyright they need permission from the owner. For example, when someone buys [[computer software]], they also need a license from the creator of the software (a copyright owner) allowing the buyer to use the software.

== Difference between license and licence ==
"License" is a [[verb]] and "licence" is a [[noun]]. "Licensing sessions" were the meetings of [[magistrates]] which decided about giving licences to sell [[alcohol]].  

In [[American English]] there is no difference in spelling between the verb "to license"  meaning to give permission, and the noun "a license" meaning the permission to do something.

== Distinction between a licence and a qualification ==
A degree in medicine is a qualification showing a person has successfully studied medicine. It is awarded for life. A licence to practice medicine is a legal permission to do so within the territory covered by the licensing authority. The licence may be taken away under certain situations.

[[File:Chain link icon.png|thumb|Link icon]]
A '''link''', also '''hyperlink''' in [[computing]], is a part of a [[chain]]. A chain is made of many pieces of [[metal]]; each piece is a link. 

Today, people also use the [[word]] link in a new way. The [[World Wide Web]] on the [[Internet]] is made of many different [[Web page]]s. The [[computer]] [[software]] that people use to make these pages ([[HTML]]) lets us go to other pages in a very fast and easy way. 

The person who makes the web page can tell the computer to show a [[word]] or a [[picture]] on the Web page as a '''link'''. This means that when we [[click]] on the link with our [[computer mouse]], the [[computer]] will show us the new page we want to see. Most links are blue, but they can be any color.

The color of the link will change to dark blue when clicked as the web browser recognises it in the browser's cache. Unless the cache is cleared, the link will always stay dark blue.

== Ways of making links ==
There are many ways in making a link on a web page. The process is different for different internet software.

=== Plain HTML ===
In <tt>.htm</tt> and <tt>.html</tt> files, a link can be created using this code:

<tt><nowiki><a href="http://www.example.com">Text of link</a></nowiki></tt>

=== WikiSyntax ===
WikiSyntax like MediaWiki uses a simpler way of making links. To create a link to another page of the same website:

<tt><nowiki>[[Page name|Link text]]</nowiki></tt> or just <tt><nowiki>[[Page name]]</nowiki></tt>.

To link to an external website:

<tt><nowiki>[http://www.example.com Link text]</nowiki></tt>, <tt><nowiki>[http://www.example.com]</nowiki></tt>, or just <tt><nowiki>http://www.example.com</nowiki></tt>.

=== BB code ===
BB code is used in forum software. To create a link:

<tt><nowiki>[url]http://www.example.com[/url]</nowiki></tt>, or <tt><nowiki>[url=http://www.example.com]Link text[/url]</nowiki></tt>

[[Category:Internet]][[File:Egyetemi Könyvtár4.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Eötvös Loránd University Library in [[Budapest]]]]
[[Image:Graz University-Library reading-room.jpg|thumb|right|250px|University Library of [[Graz]], reading-room]]

A '''library''' is a place where many [[book]]s are kept. Most libraries are public and let people take the books to use in their home. Most libraries let people borrow books for several weeks. Some belong to [[institution]]s, for example, [[company|companies]], [[church]]es, [[school]]s, and [[university|universities]]. Also a person's [[shelf|bookshelves]] at home can have many books and be a library. The people who work in libraries are librarians.

Other libraries keep famous or rare books. There are a few "[[Copyright]] libraries" which have a copy of every book which has been written in that country. Some libraries also have other things that people might like, such as [[magazine]]s, [[music]] on [[Compact disc|CDs]], or [[computer]]s where people can use the [[Internet]]. In school they offer software to learn the alphabet and other details.

A library is not a [[bookstore]] (a [[Shop|store]] that [[sales|sell]]s books).

== Public libraries ==
[[File:Seacroft library (13th May 2010).jpg|thumb|right|A small public library in the [[Seacroft]] area of [[Leeds]].]]
Many places have a public library, where anybody can join if they live in the area. With a library card, people can borrow books and take them home for several [[week]]s. It does not cost money to get a library card at most public libraries.

Books are kept on shelves in a special order so they are easy to find. Public libraries have stories and books about lots of things. Many public libraries have books and [[Compact disk|CDs]] about learning [[English language|English]]. Stories are kept in [[alphabetical]] order by the last name of the person who wrote them, the [[author]]. Books about other things are often given a special number, that refers to what they are about. They are then put on the shelf in number order. One number system used by many libraries is the [[Dewey decimal system]].

== Academic libraries ==
Many colleges and universities have large academic libraries.  These libraries are for the use of college students, professors, and researchers.  Academic libraries are used mainly for doing research like studying the solar system or how earthquakes happen.  These libraries do not have the same types of books you would find in a public library.  They usually do not have fiction books or books for children (unless they are being studied).  Academic libraries can have many books, sometimes more than a million.

== Special libraries ==
Special libraries are those libraries that are not public libraries or academic libraries.  They are usually small.  Many times a special library holds books on a particular subject or even a special kind of book.  Some special libraries keep just old books or books by Shakespeare.  A special library can be owned by a business for use only by that business.  For example, Disney World in Orlando has its own library that is not open to the public but for the use of the people who work for the company.

== Librarians ==
A [[librarian]] is a person who works in a library. Librarians help people find books and information. They can teach people how to find books and use the library.  A professional librarian is a person who went to school to study library science.  They can earn a degree called a Masters in Library Science.

== History ==
The earliest known library was discovered in Iraq and belonged to the ancient civilization in Sumer.  They didn't used paper books but instead wrote everything on clay tablets using a style of writing called cuneiform.  These tablets are over 5,000 years old.  The Library of Alexandria, in Egypt, was the largest and most important library of the ancient world.  It was destroyed when the Romans conquered Egypt in 30 BC.  Rome’s first public library was established by Asinius Pollio who was a lieutenant of Julius Caesar.  Eventually Rome would build 28 public libraries within the city.  When the Roman Empire fell in 330 AD, many books went east to the city of Byzantium where a large library was built.  Other libraries were built in monasteries and public homes.

Libraries began to appear in many Islamic cities where science and philosophy survived after the fall of the Roman Empire.  Surprisingly, Christian monks and Islamic libraries exchanged books to copy.  These books eventually made there way back to the West and helped start the Renaissance.  European universities began the practice of creating academic libraries at this time for the use of their students.

The 17th and 18th centuries was called "The Golden Age of Libraries" when national libraries were being created all over Europe.  These national libraries collected books that were published in their own country as well as some books from other countries.

[[Category:Mathematics lists|Topics]]'''Like''' can mean some different things: 

1. We can use '''to like''' to say that we find a thing is good: 
::''I like my house.'' = I think my house is good.
::''I like Jenny'' = I think Jenny is an OK person.

2. We can use '''like''' for "the same as" or "nearly the same as":
::''This [[cheese]] [[sandwich]] feels like [[rubber]]'' = the sandwich is difficult to eat, nearly the same as rubber.
::''Jenny is like her mother'' = Jenny has brown hair, and her mother also has brown hair (for example). 
::''Your pen is like my pen'' = Your pen and my pen are the same [[sort]].

3. We can also use '''like''' for "the same way as":
::''She runs like the wind'' - she and the wind are both fast.
::''She talks like a child'' - she and children speak slowly or with a high voice.

4. In a question, we can use '''like''' to ask people to talk about a thing, or to say if they find it good or not:
::''What's your house like?'' (Answer: "It has two bedrooms and a big kitchen...")
::''What was the film like?'' (Answer: "It was very good!")

5. We can also use '''like''' as "for example":
::''I often go to other countries, like France or Germany'' = I go to other countries, for example France and Germany.

6. In British and American English young people, when talking, have recently started using '''like''' as an extra word in the middle of sentences. Sometimes they use it to report what someone said, especially when mimicking the way they said it. This should never be used in writing:
::''The teacher was '''like''': "Don't do that!"''


[[As]] works in the same way as example 2 - comparing two things using either the word "like" or the word "as" is called making a '''simile''' (''As big as an elephant''). It may be better to use the word "as" for this to stop confusion with example 1.

The legislature of a [[state]] or country is a group of people, each of whom got his or her office either by winning an [[election]] or by being appointed, to vote for the best laws. The way a legislature is supposed to work can usually be found in the [[constitution]] of that state or country.

In many countries, the legislature is called a [[Parliament]], [[Congress]] or [[National Assembly]] etc. Sometimes the legislature is made up of two separate houses. This is called a "''[[bicameralism|bicameral]]''" legislature. Whereas a unicameral legislature consists of only one chamber or legislative house.

A [[county]], [[district]], [[city]], or other small area also has a [[council]], that makes the rules and laws for its level of government. The way a council works can usually be found in the area's ''[[charter]]''.

[[Category:Legislatures| ]]'''Linear algebra''' is a branch of [[mathematics]]. It came from [[mathematicians]] trying to solve systems of [[linear equation]]s. [[Vectors]] and [[matrix|matrices]] are used to solve these systems. The main objects of study currently are [[vector space]]s and [[linear mapping]]s between vector spaces. Linear algebra is useful in other branches of mathematics (e.g. [[differential equations]] and [[analytic geometry]]). It can also be applied to the real world in areas such as [[engineering]], [[physics]] and [[economics]].

Linear [[algebra]] describes ways to [[wikt:solve|solve]] and manipulate (rearrange) systems of linear [[equation]]s.

For example, consider the following equations:

:<math>\\begin{matrix}
 x &+& y &=& 0 \\\\
 x &-& 2y &=& 3
\\end{matrix}</math>

These two equations form a system of linear equations.
It is linear because none of the [[variable]]s are raised to a [[exponentiation|power]].
The [[graph]] of a '''linear''' equation in two variables is a [[straight]] [[line]].
The solution to this system is:

:<math>\\begin{matrix}
 x &=& 1 \\\\
 y &=& -1
\\end{matrix}</math>

since it makes all of the original equations valid, that is, the [[value]] on left side of the [[equals sign]] is exactly the same as the value on the right side for both equations.

Linear algebra uses a system of notation for describing system behavior, called a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. For the previous example, the [[coefficient]]s of the equations can be stored in a coefficient matrix.

London was founded by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in AD 43 and called ''Londinium''. London is also known as ''Lunnainn'' in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]],<ref>{{cite web|title=London in Scottish Gaelic|url=http://glosbe.com/en/gd/London|work=Glosbe Dictionary website|accessdate=15 April 2014}}</ref>  ''Llundain'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and ''Londain'' in [[Irish language|Irish]].

For a long time, London was a small city. All its people lived inside the walls that were built by the Romans. This area is still called the [[City of London]]. There were many villages around the city. Gradually, more and more people came to live there. Then, step by step, the villages joined together into one huge city.

The city has a huge network of [[transport]] systems. The [[Victorian era|Victorians]] built a number of railway systems in the mid-19th century. Their main stations are in London, and the lines go to every corner of [[Great Britain]]. There were originally five major companies, which were merged into a national rail network in modern times.

There is also the world's first underground railway system, [[London Underground]], which is the main way [[commuter]]s get into London. There are five [[airport]]s, though only one is actually in London (the [[City Airport]]). There is the London end of the London{{ndash}}[[Birmingham]] [[canal]], which was important to the industrial 19th century.

Most people in London are British. However, London also has many immigrants. These people come from many different countries. They speak many different languages and have different religions and cultures. There are also many people from different countries who stay in London on business. Many people visit London as tourists. They may see the famous "Sights of London". These sights include [[palace]]s, [[church]]es and [[museum]]s.

London is one of the world's most important cities for [[business]], [[finance]], and [[politics]]. It is also important for [[culture]]: [[media]], [[entertainment]], [[fashion]], and [[art]].

== History ==
The [[Roman Britain|Romans]] built a city called ''Londinium'' on the River Thames in AD [[43]]. The name ''Londinium'' (and then 'London') came from the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] language of the [[Prehistoric Britain|Ancient Britons]]. In the year AD 61, Queen [[Boudica]] (a British Celtic queen) and her army destroyed the city. Boudica [[Killed in action|killed]] [[herself]] when Romans trapped her. Then the Romans rebuilt London. London became an important trading city. After the Romans left Britain, few people lived in the city for a long time. This is because the Anglo-Saxons liked living in the countryside. In the [[9th century]], more people started living there again. It became the largest city in England. However, it did not become the capital city of England until the [[12th century]].

After the [[railway]]s were built, London grew very big. Greater London has 33 [[London Boroughs]] and a mayor. The old [[City of London]] is only a square mile in size but has its own Lord Mayor.

Another famous old part of Greater London is Westminster, which was always a different city from the City of London. In Westminster is [[Westminster Abbey]] (a cathedral), The Palace of Westminster (the [[Houses of Parliament]], with Big Ben), and [[10 Downing Street]] (where the [[Prime Minister]] lives).

== London Underground ==
The [[London Underground]] is a system of [[electric]] [[Railway|trains]] which are in London, [[United Kingdom]]. It is the oldest underground [[railway]] in the world. It started running in 1863 as the ''Metropolitan Railway''. After the opening the system was copied in many other cities, for example [[New York]] and [[Madrid]]. Even though it is called ''the Underground'' about half of it is above the ground. The "Tube" is a slang name for the London Underground, because the tunnels for some of the lines are round tubes running through the ground. The Underground has got 274 [[Railway station|stations]] and over 408 [[km]] of [[Railway track|track]]. From 2006–2007 over 1 [[billion]] passengers used the underground.

[[Category:Cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants]][[image:CubeLitre.svg|200px|thumb|'''One litre''' has the same volume as this cube. Each side is 10&nbsp;cm<br>1 litre of water = 1 kilogram of water (at 4&nbsp;°C)]]
A '''litre''' ('''liter''' in the [[United States]]) is one of the [[metric system|metric units]] of [[volume]]. It is not an [[International System of Units|SI unit]]. 

One litre is the volume of one cubic [[metre|decimetre]], that is a [[cube]] of 10 x 10 x 10 [[centimetre|centimetres]]. One litre of [[water]] has the [[mass]] of exactly one [[kilogram]]. This results from the definition given in 1795, where the [[gram]] was defined as the weight of one cubic centimetre of melting ice.<ref name=decree>
{{cite web
| url = http://smdsi.quartier-rural.org/histoire/18germ_3.htm

</ref>

The [[symbol]] for litre is "[[L]]" or "l". 

For smaller volumes the [[decilitre]] is used: 10 [[deciliter|dl]] = one litre.

For smaller volumes the [[centilitre]] is used: 100 [[centilitre|cl]] = one litre.

For smaller volumes the [[millilitre]] is used: 1000 [[millilitre|ml]] = one litre.

The capital letter "L" is preferred by some people as the small "l" can look like the number one "1".

* 1 litre = 0.2200 [[Imperial unit|imperial]] [[gallon]]s
* 1 litre = 0.2642 [[U.S. customary units|US]] gallons

* 1 imperial gallon = 4.5461 litres
* 1 US gallon = 3.7854 litres
* 1 litre = 1 dm<sup>3</sup>

Due to public demand,<ref name=DoWMU/> the commission said that the [[cubic metre]] was too big for everyday use. They said that a new unit based on the old cadil should be used instead. One cadil was to be 0.001 cubic metres. This was equivalent to a [[cube]] with sides 10&nbsp;cm.<ref>{{cite book

In 1795 the kilogram was defined to be exactly one litre of water at 4&nbsp;°C. In 1799 the kilogram was redefined. The new definition said that the kilogram was the mass of the ''[[kilogram|kilogram des archives]]''.

In 1960 the [[International System of Units|SI]] was introduced.  The BIPM changed the definition of the litre back to "one dm<sup>3</sup>". The litre is not part of SI. The BIPM defined the litre<ref group = Note>The [[hectare|are]] and the [[tonne]] were also defined as  "Non-SI units accepted for use with the SI".</ref> as a "Non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI".

:''This article is about the fruit. For the colour see [[Lime (colour)]].''

'''Lime''' is a fruit tree, and the [[fruit]] itself . They are [[citrus]] fruits similar to [[lemon]]s. Limes have a lot of [[vitamin C]]. [[Sailor]]s from [[Britain]] were given lemon or lime juice to stop them falling ill with [[scurvy]]. This is how they got the [[nickname]] ''Limey''.

Limes are small, round and bright green. If they stay on the tree for a long time they turn yellow. Then they look like small round [[lemon]]s.

Lime juice is used in cooking and in drinks. Lime oils are often used in perfumes, used for cleaning, and used for [[aromatherapy]].

Lime tastes acidic and [[bitter]]. Lime juice is also made from limes.

== Different kinds of limes ==
* [[Persian lime]] – This lime is most often sold in supermarkets as lime.
* [[Key lime]] – Smaller than the Persian lime, used to mix [[Cocktail]]s and make [[pie]]s.
* [[Kaffir lime]] – Very small fruits, [[vegetable oil]] from the leaves is used for [[perfume]]s, leaves are used for cooking.

[[Category:Citrus]][[File:Egyptian A'h-mosè or Rhind Papyrus (1065x1330).png|thumb|The [[Rhind Papyrus]] is the source of most of modern knowledge about mathematics in Ancient Egypt]]

'''Mathematics''' is the study of [[number]]s, [[shape]]s and [[pattern]]s. The word is  sometimes shortened to '''maths''' (in [[England]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]]) or '''math''' (in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]). [[Mathematician]]s are people who do mathematics. Mathematics is useful for solving [[problem]]s that occur in the real world, so many people besides [[mathematician]]s study and use mathematics. Today, some mathematics is needed in many jobs. [[Business]], [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[construction]] need some knowledge of mathematics.

Mathematicians [[wikt:solve|solve]] [[problem]]s by using [[logic]]. Mathematicians often use [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]. [[Deduction]] is a special way of [[wikt:think|thinking]] to [[wikt:discover|discover]] and prove new [[wikt:truth|truths]] using old truths. To a mathematician, the reason something is true is just as important as the fact that it is true. Using deduction is what makes mathematical thinking different from other kinds of thinking.

== About ==
''Mathematics'' includes the [[Education|study]] of:
* Numbers (example 3+6=9)
* [[Structure]]: how things are [[organisation|organized]].
* [[wikt:place|Place]]: where things are and their arrangement.
* [[wikt:change|Change]]: how things become different over time.

Mathematics uses [[logic]], paper, and calculator. These things are used to create general [[rule]]s, which are an important part of mathematics. These rules leave out [[information]] that is not important so that a single rule can cover many situations. By finding general rules, mathematics [[solution|solves]] many [[problem]]s at the same time as these rules can be used on other problems.

A ''proof'' gives a reason why a rule in mathematics is correct. This is done by using certain other rules that everyone agrees are correct, which are called ''axioms''. A rule that has a proof is sometimes called a ''theorem''. Experts in mathematics perform research to create new theorems. Sometimes experts find an idea that they think is a theorem but can not find a proof for it. That idea is called a ''conjecture'' until they find a proof.

Sometimes, mathematics finds and studies rules or ideas in the real world that we don't understand yet. Often in mathematics, ideas and rules are [[choice|chosen]] because they are considered simple or neat. On the other hand, sometimes these ideas and rules are found in the real world after they are studied in mathematics; this has happened many times in the past. In general, studying the rules and ideas of mathematics can help us [[knowledge|understand]] the world better.

[[Category:Mathematics|*]]{{monththisyear|3}}
'''March''' is the third [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], coming between [[February]] and [[April]]. It has 31 days. March is named after [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the [[Roman mythology|Roman god]] of war.

== The Month ==
[[File:Narcissus pseudonarcissus 030405.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The [[daffodil]] is a symbol of the month of March, when [[spring]] begins in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].]]
In [[Roman Empire|ancient Rome]], March was called Martius. It was named after the war god ([[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]) and the Romans thought that it was a lucky time to begin a war. Before [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[calendar]] reform, March was the first month of the year in the Roman calendar, as the [[winter]] was considered to be a monthless period.

March has 31 days, and is one of seven months in the year to have that number of days. In [[common year]]s it starts on the same day of the week as [[February]], and it always starts on the same day of the week as [[November]] of the same year. In a common year, March starts on the same day of the week as [[June]] of the previous year, and in [[leap year]]s starts on the same day of the week as [[September]] and [[December]] of the previous year. Every year, March ends on the same day of the week as [[June]], and ends on the same day as [[December]] of the previous year if it is a [[leap year]]. In leap years, the day before [[March 1]] is [[February 29]]. This determines the position of each day of the year from there on. As an example, [[March 1]] is usually the 60th day of the year, but in a leap year is the 61st day.

In terms of [[season]]s, March is a month that has an [[equinox]], with daylight and darkness of roughly the same number of hours, halfway between the [[December]] and [[June]] [[solstice]]s. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], [[spring]] starts in this month, while it is [[autumn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The official start of either season is [[March 1]], though the [[equinox]] can fall on [[March 20]] or [[March 21|21]], occasionally on [[March 19]]. The northern spring equinox marks the start of the [[Iran]]ian [[New Year]] and [[Baha'i]] [[New Year]]. It is from the [[March 21]] date that [[Easter]]'s date is calculated, on the Sunday after the first [[full moon]] in spring, meaning it can fall between [[March 22]] and [[April 25]] in Western [[Christianity]]. 

March's flower is the [[daffodil]] and its [[birthstone]]s are the [[bloodstone]] and [[aquamarine]]. The meaning of the bloodstone is courage. The star signs for March are [[Pisces]] ([[February 20]] to [[March 20]]) and [[Aries]] ([[March 21]] to [[April 20]]).

{{months}}{{monththisyear|5}}
'''May''' is the fifth [[month]] of the [[year]], coming between [[April]] and [[June]]. It has 31 [[day]]s. The month of May might have been named for the [[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] [[Maia]], or more likely the Roman [[goddess]] of [[fertility]] [[Bona Dea]], whose festival was held in May.

May's [[flower]] is the [[Lily of the Valley]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[emerald]]. The meaning of the emerald is success in love.

== The Month ==
[[File:XN Fruehjahrswiese 00.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Flower]]s and [[Tree]]s in full bloom in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], where May is in late [[Spring]].]]
May comes between [[April]] and [[June]] and is the fifth month of the year in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. It has 31 days, being one of seven months to do so. In the older [[Roman calendar]], May was the third month of the year. It is a [[spring]] month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and an [[autumn]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. May is likely to have been named after the Roman [[God|goddess]] [[Maia]], though there is a theory that May might have its name from the Latin "Maiores", meaning "Seniors". The same theory suggests that [[June]] would then be named from "Iuniores", meaning "Juniors".

In any [[year]], no month starts or ends on the same day of the week as May, though [[January]] of the following year starts and ends on the same days of the week as May. In a [[common year]] it ends on the same day of the week as [[August]] and [[November]] of the previous year and starts on the same day of the week as [[August]] of the previous year. In a [[leap year]], May starts on the same day of the week as [[February]], [[March]] and [[November]] of the previous year and ends on the same day of the week as [[March]] and [[June]] of the previous year.

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], May is in late [[Spring]], and [[May Day]] on [[May 1]] and [[Walpurgis Night]], during the night of [[April 30]] to [[May 1]], are symbolic of the transition from [[winter]] to [[summer]]. In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], it is in [[autumn]], and comes just before the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] winter, when [[emperor penguin]]s breed there.

'''Music''' is a form of [[entertainment]] that puts [[sound]]s together in a way that people like or find interesting. Most music includes people [[singing]] with their voices or playing [[musical instrument]]s, such as the [[piano]], [[guitar]], or [[drum]]s.

The word ''music'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''μουσική'' (''mousike''), which means "(art) of the Muses". In [[Ancient Greece]] the [[Muse]]s included the [[god]]desses of music, [[poetry]], [[art]], and [[dance]]. Someone who makes music is called a [[musician]].

== What is music? ==
Music is sound that has been organized by using [[rhythm]], [[melody]] or [[harmony]]. If someone bangs saucepans while [[cooking]], it makes noise. If a person bangs saucepans or pots in a rhythmic way, they are making a simple type of music.

There are four things which music has most of the time:
* Music often has ''[[pitch (music)|pitch]]''. This means high and low [[note (music)|notes]]. [[Tune]]s are made of notes that go up or down or stay on the same pitch.
* Music often has ''[[rhythm]]''. Rhythm is the way the musical sounds and silences are put together in a sequence. Every tune has a rhythm that can be tapped. Music usually has a regular beat.
* Music often has ''[[dynamics (music)|dynamics]]''. This means whether it is quiet or loud or somewhere in between.
* Music often has ''[[timbre]]''. This is a French word (pronounced the French way: "TAM-br"). The "timbre" of a sound is the way that a sound is interesting. The sort of sound might be harsh, gentle, dry, warm, or something else. Timbre is what makes a [[clarinet]] sound different from an [[oboe]], and what makes one person's [[voice]] sound different from another person.

=== Definitions ===
There is no simple definition of music which covers all cases. It is an art form, and [[opinion]]s come into play. Music is whatever people think is music. A different approach is to list the qualities music must have, such as, sound which has rhythm, melody, pitch, timbre, etc.

These and other attempts, do not capture all aspects of music, or leave out examples which definitely are music. According to Thomas Clifton, music is "a certain reciprocal relation established between a person, his [[behavior]], and a sounding object".<ref name=Clifton>Clifton, Thomas. 1983. Music as heard: a study in applied phenomenology. New Haven and London: Yale University Press. ISBN 0-300-02091-0</ref><sup>p10</sup> Musical experience and the music, together, are called [[phenomenon|phenomena]], and the activity of describing phenomena is called [[phenomenology]].

== History ==
[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Nacht 004.jpg|thumb|230px|Musicians of [[Amun]], Tomb of  Nakht, 18th Dynasty, Western [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]]]

Even in the [[stone age]] people made music. The first music was probably made trying to imitate sounds and rhythms that occurred naturally. Human music may echo these [[phenomenon|phenomena]] using [[pattern]]s, [[repetition]] and [[tonality]]. This kind of music is still here today. [[Shamanism|Shamans]] sometimes imitate sounds that are heard in [[nature]].<ref name=onom>[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf  Hoppál 2006: 143]</ref><ref name=soy>Diószegi 1960: 203</ref> It may also serve as [[entertainment]] (games),<ref name=Nattiez>Nattiez, Jean-Jacques. 1990. ''Music and discourse: toward a semiology of music''. Translated by Carolyn Abbate. Princeton: Princeton University Press. ISBN 0-691-09136-6</ref><ref name=desch>[http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/inuit.htm Deschênes 2002]</ref> or have practical uses, like [[lure|luring]] animals when [[hunting]].<ref name=Nattiez/>

Some animals also can use music. [[Songbird]]s use [[song]] to [[wikt:simple:protect|protect]] their [[territory]], or to attract a [[mate]]. [[Monkey]]s have been seen beating hollow logs. This may, of course, also serve to defend the territory.

The first musical instrument used by humans was probably the [[voice]]. The human voice can make many different kinds of sounds. The [[larynx]] (voice box) is like a [[wind instruments|wind instrument]].

The oldest known [[Neanderthal]] [[hyoid]] bone with the modern human form was found in 1983,<ref>{{cite journal | author = B. Arensburg A.M.  Tillier B. Vandermeersch H. Duday L.A. Schepartz & Y.

Most likely the first [[rhythm]] instruments or [[percussion instruments]] involved the [[clapping]] of hands, stones hit together, or other things that are useful to keep a beat. There are finds of this type that date back to the [[paleolithic]]. Some of these are ambiguous, as they can be used either as a [[tool]] or a musical instrument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dar.cam.ac.uk/dcrr/dcrr002.pdf|title="The Evolutionary Origins and Archaeology of Music|author=Ian Morley|year=2003|format=pdf}}</ref>

The oldest known wooden pipes were discovered near [[Greystones]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], in 2004. A wood-lined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood, between 30 and 50&nbsp;cm long, tapered at one end, but without any finger holes. They may once have been strapped together.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s1105308.htm</ref>

In 1986 several bone flutes were found in [[Jiahu]] in Henan Province, China. They date to about 6,000 BC. They have between 5 and 8 holes each and were made from the hollow bones of a bird, the [[Red-crowned Crane]]. At the time of the discovery, one was found to be still playable. The bone flute plays both the five- or seven-note scale of [[Xia Zhi]] and six-note scale of [[Qing Shang]] of the ancient [[Chinese musical system]].

=== Ancient times ===
It is not known what the earliest music of the [[cave]] people was like. Some [[architecture]], even some [[painting]]s, are thousands of years old, but old music could not survive until people learned to write it down. The only way we can guess about early music is by looking at very old paintings that show people playing musical instruments, or by finding them in [[archaeology|archaeological]] digs (digging underground to find old things). The earliest piece of music that was ever written down and that has not been lost was discovered on a tablet written in [[Hurrians|Hurrian]], a [[language]] spoken in and around northern [[Mesopotamia]] (where Iraq is today), from about 1500 BC.

=== Middle Ages ===
Another early piece of written music that has survived was a [[round (music)|round]] called ''[[Sumer Is Icumen In]]''. It was written down by a [[monk]] around the year 1250. Much of the music in the [[Middle Ages]] (roughly 450-1420) was [[folk music]] played by working people who wanted to sing or dance. When people played instruments, they were usually playing for dancers. However, most of the music that was written down was for the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic church]]. This music was written for monks to sing in church. It is called Chant (or [[Gregorian chant]]).

=== Renaissance ===
In the [[Renaissance]] (roughly 1400-1550) there was a lot of music, and many composers wrote music that has survived so that it can be performed, played or sung today. The name for this period (Renaissance) is a French word which means "rebirth". This period was called the "rebirth" because many new types of [[art]] and music were [[birth|reborn]] during this time.

Some very beautiful music was written for use in church services (sacred music) by the Italian composer [[Giovanni da Palestrina]] (1525-1594). In Palestrina's music, many singers sing together (this is called a [[Choir (music)|choir]]). There was also plenty of music not written for the church, such as happy [[dance music]] and romantic love songs. Popular instruments during the Renaissance included the [[viol]]s (a [[string instrument]] played with a [[bow (music)|bow)]], [[lute]]s (a plucked stringed instrument that is a little like a [[guitar]]), and the [[virginal]], a small, quiet [[keyboard instrument]].

=== Baroque ===
In the arts, the Baroque was a Western cultural era, which began near the turn of the 17th century in Rome. It was exemplified by drama and grandeur in sculpture, painting, literature, dance, and music.<ref>{{cite book |first=Paul|last=Fargis|title=The New York Public Library Desk Reference|year=1998|edition=third|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan General Reference|page=262|isbn=0-02-862169-7}}</ref> In music, the term 'Baroque' applies to the final period of dominance of imitative counterpoint, where different voices and instruments echo each other but at different pitches, sometimes inverting the echo, and even reversing thematic material.

The popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church which had decided at the time of the Council of Trent that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement. The upper class also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumphant power and control. Baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts, grand staircases and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence. In similar profusions of detail, art, music, architecture, and literature inspired each other in the Baroque cultural movement as artists explored what they could create from repeated and varied patterns. Some traits and aspects of Baroque paintings that differentiate this style from others are the abundant amount of details, often bright polychromy, less realistic faces of subjects, and an overall sense of awe, which was one of the goals in Baroque art.

The word baroque probably derives from the ancient Portuguese noun "barroco"<ref>''OED'' Online. Accessed 6 June 2008.</ref> which is a pearl that is not round but of unpredictable and elaborate shape. Hence, in informal usage, the word baroque can simply mean that something is "elaborate", with many details, without reference to the Baroque styles of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

=== Classical period ===
In western music, the [[Classical music period|classical period]] means music from about 1750 to 1825. It was the time of composers like [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. Orchestras became bigger, and composers often wrote longer pieces of music called [[symphony|symphonies]] that had several sections (called [[movement (music)|movements]]). Some movements of a symphony were loud and fast; other movements were quiet and sad. The form of a piece of music was very important at this time. Music had to have a nice 'shape'. They often used a structure which was called [[sonata form]].

Another important type of music was the [[string quartet]], which is a piece of music written for two [[violin]]s, a [[viola]], and a [[violoncello]]. Like symphonies, string quartet music had several sections. Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven each wrote many famous string quartets.

The piano was invented during this time. Composers liked the piano, because it could be used to play dynamics (getting louder or getting softer). Other popular instruments included the [[violin]], the [[violoncello]], the [[flute]], the [[clarinet]], and the [[oboe]].

=== Romantic period ===
The 19th century is called the [[Romantic music|Romantic period]]. Composers were particularly interested in conveying their emotions through music. An important instrument from the Romantic period was the [[piano]]. Some composers, such as [[Frederic Chopin]] wrote subdued, expressive, quietly emotional piano pieces. Often music described a feeling or told a story using sounds. Other composers, such as [[Franz Schubert]] wrote songs for a singer and a piano player called [[Lied]] (the German word for "song"). These Lieder (plural of Lied) told stories by using the [[lyrics]] (words) of the song and by the imaginative piano [[accompaniment (music)|accompaniments]]. Other composers, like Richard Strauss, and [[Franz Liszt]] created narratives and told stories using only music, which is called a tone poem. Composers, such as [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Johannes Brahms]] used the piano to play loud, dramatic, strongly emotional music.

Many composers began writing music for bigger orchestras, with as many as 100 instruments. It was the period of "[[Nationalism]]" (the feeling of being proud of one's country) when many composers made music using [[folk music|folksong]] or melodies from their country. Lots of famous composers lived at this time such as [[Franz Schubert]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Frederic Chopin]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]] and [[Richard Wagner]].

=== Modern times ===
From about 1900 onwards is called the "modern period". Many [[20th century]] composers wanted to compose music that sounded different from the Classical and Romantic music. Modern composers searched for new ideas, such as using new instruments, different forms, different sounds, or different [[harmony|harmonies]].

The composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (1874-1951) wrote pieces which were [[atonal]] (meaning that they did not sound as if they were in any clear musical key). Later, Schoenberg invented a new system for writing music called [[twelve-tone system]]. Music written with the twelve-tone system sounds strange to some, but is mathematical in nature, often making sense only after careful study. Pure twelve-tone music was popular among academics in the fifties and sixties, but some composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]] use it today, when it is necessary to get a certain feel.

One of the most important 20th-century composers, [[Igor Stravinsky]] (1882-1971), wrote music with very complicated (difficult) [[chord]]s (groups of notes that are played together) and [[rhythm]]s. Some composers thought music was getting too complicated and so they wrote [[Minimalism|Minimalist]] pieces which use very simple ideas. In the 1950s and 1960s, composers such as [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] experimented with [[electronic music]], using electronic circuits, [[amplifier]]s and [[loudspeaker]]s. In the 1970s, composers began using electronic synthesizers and musical instruments from [[rock and roll]] music, such as the [[electric guitar]]. They used these new instruments to make new sounds.

Composers writing in the 1990s and the 2000s, such as [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] (born 1947) and [[James MacMillan]] (born 1959) often use a mixture of all these ideas, but they like to write [[tonality|tonal]] music with easy tunes as well.

A.R.Rahman is one of the most famous musicians in the world from India. Other good examples are Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Bruno Mars etc.
One direction is one of the most famous band. Zayn Malik is known for his incredible vocals and high notes

==== Electronic music ====
Music can be produced electronically. This is most commonly done by computers, keyboards, electric guitars and disk tables. They can mimic traditional instruments, and also produce very different sounds. 21st-century electronic music is commonly made with computer programs and hardware mixers.

==== Jazz ====
[[Jazz]] is a type of music that was invented around 1900 in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] in the south of the [[United States|USA]]. There were many black musicians living there who played a style of music called [[blues]] music. Blues music was influenced by [[Africa]]n music (because the black people in the United States had come to the United States as [[slave]]s. They were taken from Africa by force). Blues music was a music that was played by singing, using the harmonica, or the acoustic guitar. Many blues songs had sad lyrics about sad emotions (feelings) or sad experiences, such as losing a job, a family member dying, or having to go to [[jail]] (prison).

Jazz music mixed together blues music with [[Europe]]an music. Some black composers such as [[Scott Joplin]] were writing music called [[ragtime]], which had a very different rhythm from standard European music, but used notes that were similar to some European music. Ragtime was a big influence on early jazz, called Dixieland jazz. Jazz musicians used instruments such as the [[trumpet]], [[saxophone]], and [[clarinet]] were used for the tunes (melodies), drums for [[percussion]] and plucked [[double bass]], [[piano]], [[banjo]] and [[guitar]] for the background rhythm (rhythmic section). Jazz is usually [[improvisation|improvised]]: the players make up (invent) the music as they play. Even though jazz musicians are making up the music, jazz music still has [[rule]]s; the musicians play a series of chords (groups of notes) in order.

Jazz music has a swinging rhythm. The word "swing" is hard to explain. For a rhythm to be a "swinging rhythm" it has to feel natural and relaxed. Swing rhythm is not even like a march. There is a long-short feel instead of a same-same feel. A "swinging rhythm" also gets the people who are listening excited, because they like the sound of it. Some people say that a "swinging rhythm" happens when all the jazz musicians start to feel the same pulse and energy from the song. If a jazz band plays very well together, people will say "that is a swinging jazz band" or "that band really swings well."

Jazz influenced other types of music like the [[classical music|Western art music]] from the 1920s and 1930s. Art music composers such as [[George Gershwin]] wrote music that was influenced by jazz. Jazz music influenced [[pop music]] songs. In the 1930s and 1940s, many pop music songs began using chords or melodies from jazz songs. One of the best known jazz musicians was [[Louis Armstrong]] (1900-1971).

==== Pop music ====
{{main |Pop music}}
"Pop" music is a type of ''popular'' music that many people like to listen to. The term "pop music" can be used for all kinds of music that was written to be popular. The word "pop music" was used from about 1880 onwards, when a type of music called music was popular.

Modern pop music grew out of 1950s [[rock and roll]], (for example [[Chuck Berry]], [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Little Richard]])<ref>{{Gilliland |show=5 |title=Hail, Hail, Rock 'n' Roll}} Shows 5, 3, 6.</ref> and [[rockabilly]] (for example [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Buddy Holly]]).{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=shows 7, 12}}   In the 1960s, [[The Beatles]] became a famous pop music group.{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=shows 27-28, 35, 39}} In the 1970s, other styles of music were mixed with pop music, such as [[funk]] and [[soul music]]. Pop music generally has a heavy (strong) beat, so that it is good for dancing. Pop singers normally sing with microphones that are plugged into an [[amplifier]] and a [[loudspeaker]].

== Musical notation ==
{{Main|Musical notation}}
[[File:Mozart k545 opening.png|thumb|right|360px|''[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] : ''First movement of the piano sonata K545'' - an example of writing music in [[staff (music)|staff]]s]]"Musical notation" is the way music is written down. Music needs to be written down in order to be saved and remembered for future performances. In this way composers (people who write music) can tell others how to play the musical piece as it was meant to be played.

=== Solfège ===
Solfège (also called solfa) is the way tones are named. It was made in order to give a name to the several tones and pitches. For example, the eight basic notes "Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do" are just the names of the eight notes that confirm the [[major scale]].

=== Written music ===
Music can be written in several ways. When it is written on a [[staff (music)|staff]] (like in the example shown), the pitches (tones) and their duration are represented by symbols called [[Note (music)|notes]]. Notes are to put on the lines and in the spaces between the lines. Each position says which tone must be played. The higher the note is in the staff, the higher the pitch of the tone. The lower the notes are, the lower the pitch. The duration of the notes (how long they are played for) is shown by making the note "heads" black or white, and by giving them stems and flags.

Music can also be written with letters, naming them as in the solfa "Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do" or representing them by letters. The next table shows how each note of the solfa is represented in the [[Standard Notation]]:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Solfa Name !! Standard Notation
|-
| Do || C
|-
| Re || D
|-
| Mi || E
|-
| Fa || F
|-
| Sol || G
|-
| La || A
|-
| Ti || B
|}
The Standard Notation was made to simplify the lecture of music notes, although it is mostly used to represent [[Chord (Music)|chords]] and the names of the [[Scale (Music)|music scales]].

These ways to represent music ease the way a person reads music. There are more ways to write and represent music, but they are less known and may be more complicated.

== How to enjoy music ==
=== By listening ===
People can enjoy music by listening to it. They can go to [[concert]]s to hear musicians perform. [[Classical music]] is usually performed in [[concert hall]]s, but sometimes huge festivals are organized in which it is performed outside, in a field or stadium, like pop festivals. People can listen to music on [[compact disc|CDs]], [[PC|Computers]], [[iPod]]s, [[television]], the [[radio]], [[cassette/record-player]]s and even [[Cell phone|mobile phones]].

There is so much music today, in [[elevator]]s, shopping [[mall]]s, and [[Shop|stores]], that it often becomes a background sound that we do not really hear. Sometimes it is good to listen more closely to music: by trying to hear the different instruments and what types of notes the instruments are playing.

=== By playing or singing ===
People can learn to play an instrument. Probably the most common for complete beginners is the [[piano]] or [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]], the [[guitar]], or the [[recorder]] (which is certainly the cheapest to buy). After they have learnt to play [[scale (music)|scales]], play simple [[tune]]s and read the simplest [[musical notation]], then they can think about which instrument for further development. They should choose an instrument that is practical for their size. For example, a very short child cannot play a full size [[double bass]], because the double bass is over five feet high. People should choose an instrument that they enjoy playing, because playing regularly is the only way to get better. Finally, it helps to have a good [[teacher]].

=== By composing ===
Anyone can make up his or her own pieces of music. It is not difficult to compose simple songs or melodies (tunes). It's easier for people who can play an instrument themselves. All it takes is experimenting with the sounds that an instrument makes. Someone can make up a piece that tells a story, or just find a nice tune and think about ways it can be changed each time it is repeated. The instrument might be someone's own voice.

'''Madrid''' (pronounced: “mah-DRID” or /məˈdrɪd/) is the [[Capital (city)|capital]] and largest city of [[Spain]]. The capital used to be [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] until [[1561]].

Madrid is in the middle of Spain, in the [[Community of Madrid]]. The Community is a large area that includes the city as well as small towns and villages outside the city. 7 million people live in the Community. More than 3 million live in the city itself. It is the largest city of Spain and, at 655 m (2,100 ft) above [[sea level]], the highest capital of any [[Europe]]an country.  It is the third largest city in the European Union.  It has two footballs teams, [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[Atlético Madrid]].

Madrid was ruled by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s from the [[2nd century]]. After AD 711 it was occupied by the [[Moor]]s. In [[1083]] Spain was ruled again by Spaniards. [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] kings ruled the country. By the mid-[[16th century]] it had become the capital of a very large [[empire]]. Spain was ruled by monarchs from the [[House of Habsburg]], then the [[House of Bourbon]]. After the [[Spanish Civil War]] it was ruled by a dictator until the mid-[[1970]]s when it became a [[democracy]].

As it is the capital city, Madrid is where the [[monarch]] lives and also where the [[government]] meets.

Madrid is the [[finance|financial]] centre of [[Spain]]. Many large [[business]]es have their main offices there.

Although it is a modern city, a lot of its history can be seen and felt as one walks along the streets and in the large [[town square|squares]] of the city. There are beautiful [[park]]s, famous buildings, [[art gallery|art galleries]] and [[concert hall]]s. The [[summer]] months are very hot and the [[winter]] months are very cold.

== History ==
[[File:Puerta_de_Alcal%C3%A1_2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Puerta de Alcalá]]
During the history of [[Spain]] many different people have lived there. The [[Phoenician]]s came in 1100 BC, followed by [[Carthaginian]]s, [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s, [[Vandals]], [[Visigoth]]s and [[Moor]]s. It was not until [[1492]], when the [[Catholic Monarchs]] got power, that Spain became a united country. [[Jew]]s and Moors, who had lived happily there for many years, were driven away. Spain became very rich because it conquered many overseas countries, especially in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. However, Spain fought many wars and lost much of its [[treasure]]. It was very poor in [[1936]] when the [[Civil War]] was fought. General Franco became a harsh [[dictator]] until [[1975]] when [[Juan Carlos I]] was brought back to Spain and made king. There is now a democratic government.

In [[prehistoric]] times people lived in the area which is now Madrid. The Romans lived there for several centuries. The origin of today’s city really starts in the [[9th century]] when Muhammad I had a small [[palace]] built where the Palacio Real stands today. The Moors built strong forts in Madrid in [[865]] and put a wall round the city. These walls stood until [[1476]] when they were knocked down. In [[1561]] [[Felipe I]] moved the royal court from [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] to Madrid. Madrid had now become the capital of a very large [[empire]]. Over the next years and [[decade]]s the [[Plaza Mayor]] was built and many great buildings and monuments, many of which still stand.

When [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella of Castile]] came to Madrid, Spain had become a very rich country. The [[16th century|16th]] and [[17th century|17th centuries]] are now known as the “Golden Century”. Their grandson was the famous [[Charles I of Spain]] (also known as [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]). He liked his court to be in [[Sevilla|Seville]]. His son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] (1527–1598) moved the [[court]] to Madrid in 1561. 
  
In the late 1800s there was a revolt, known as the [[First Spanish Republic]]. Later the monarchy was restored, but then there was a [[Second Spanish Republic]] followed by the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The Second Spanish Republic started on 14 April 1931 and was celebrated in La puerta del Sol which is the center of the city. Madrid suffered a lot in this war. It was bombed by airplanes.

During the [[dictatorship]] of [[Francisco Franco]], especially during the [[1960]]s, the south of Madrid became very industrialized, and many people from the [[rural]] areas moved to Madrid especially to the south east of the city.

When General Franco had died and democracy was restored, Madrid became more prosperous. During the [[1980]]s and [[1990]]s many new buildings were put up.

== Geography ==
The region of Madrid has quite a dry climate. Most rain falls in [[autumn]] and [[spring]]. The winters are cold because it is so high up, and sometimes there is snow. The summers are hot. Often the temperature is above 30&nbsp;°C (86&nbsp;°F) in July and can often reach 40&nbsp;°C (104&nbsp;°F). At night it is much cooler. This is why people have a sleep (siesta) in the afternoon when it is too hot to do anything. Then they come out again in the evening and often eat dinner late at night.

== Famous buildings in Madrid ==
[[File:Palacio Real (Madrid) 07.jpg|thumb|Madrid Royal Palace]]
[[Royal Palace of Madrid|Spain's Royal Palace is in Madrid]]. It is one of the largest palaces in all of [[Western Europe]]. But the [[king]] and his family do not live there anymore; they live in a smaller palace, and only use the Royal Palace for important events, like meeting other kings and other official ceremonies. One can go inside the [[Royal Palace of Madrid|Royal Palace]] and learn about the history of Spanish monarchy.

Other famous buildings are: The [[Museo del Prado|Prado Museum]], the [[Temple of Debod]], the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Santiago Bernabeú Stadium]] and the [[Cuatro Torres Business Area]].
== Art galleries ==
There are a lot of very big and important [[art]] [[museum]]s in Madrid. The most famous ones are the [[Prado Museum]], the [[Queen Sofia Museum]], and the [[Thyssen-Bornemisza museum]]. These show off paintings, [[sculpture]]s, and other works of art from some of the most famous artists in the world.

Many famous, important, and valuable works of art are in these museums. For example, the Queen Sofia museum has a famous painting by [[Pablo Picasso]], called ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]''. Picasso painted this painting to show how sad and angry it made him when the [[Germany|German]] [[Nazi]]s destroyed a town in Spain called [[Guernica (town)|Guernica]] in 1937. Picasso had said that the painting should never return to Spain until it was a [[democracy]] again. Once that happened, they built the Queen Sofia museum just to have a good place to put it.

== Other famous sights ==

There are many other sights to see in Madrid. Many people go to see the [[Plaza Mayor]] which was a market place. The [[Plaza de la Villa]] was another famous market place. There are a lot of shops along the [[Gran Via]]. Real Madrid football fans celebrate at the Plaza de [[Cibeles]]. Two famous gates to see are the [[Puerta del Sol]] and the [[Puerta de Alcalá]]. A more recent landmark is the [[Almudena Cathedral]].

Madrid has some lovely parks. The [[Retiro Park]] is the most famous. The [[Cristal Palace]] can be found in this park.

The [[Plaza de Toros]] is visited by many tourists. Many madrileños (people from Madrid) enjoy [[bullfighting|bullfights]] there.

One of the most recent sites built in Madrid is the [[KIO Towers]]. These are also known as the Gateway to Europe.

'''Montreal''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|m|ʌ|n|t|r|i|ˈ|ɔː|l}}, spelled ''Montréal'' in [[French language|French]]) is a [[city]] in the country of [[Canada]]. It is the largest city in the [[province]] of [[Quebec]] and the second-largest city in Canada. It is the second-largest [[French language|French-speaking]] city in the world after [[Paris]].

Montreal is built on an island sitting in the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. More than three million people live in the Montreal region. At the center of Montreal is a mountain called [[Mount Royal]].

Most of the people who live in Montreal speak [[French language|French]], but [[English language|English]] is commonly spoken as well as a [[second language]].

== History ==
The name 'Montréal' comes from ''Mont Royal'', which means 'Royal Mountain' in [[French language|French]].

Montreal has always played a very important part in the history and development of Canada. It continues to be a large Canadian industrial and commercial center, as well as a major sea port (via the Saint Lawrence River). It once was the largest city in Canada, before [[Toronto]] grew to be larger.

Tourists visit Montreal for its historical and cultural interest. One can visit the Old City in horse-drawn carriages, where many buildings from the earliest years stand and remind of the way of life that started in the [[New World]], when Montreal was just a fur trading outpost belonging to [[France]] over 350 years ago.

==Geography==
Montreal is in the southwest of [[Quebec]], 530 [[kilometres]] north of [[New York City]]. The city itself is located on an [[island]], the Island of Montreal. Near the downtown area, there is a hill called ''Mount Royal'' (''Mont Royal'' in French).
== Economy ==
[[File:TourDeLaBourse night.jpg|left|upright|thumb|The [[stock exchange]] tower in downtown Montreal]]
Montreal's [[economy]] is the second largest in [[Canada]]. The city's [[port]] is the biggest inland port (a port that is not on the [[sea]]) in the world. Many large corporations have their main offices in Montreal. It also hosts  many international organizations like [[ICAO]], the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]], and [[IATA]]. The city is home to four major [[university|Universities]], welcoming students from all parts of Canada and from all over the world.
<br />
Montreal is also known for its [[culture|cultural]] production sector. Because the city has many different buildings, [[movie]]s are easy to film there. The [[circus]] troupe (group) ''Cirque du Soleil'' is from Montreal. The city is also known for its festivals, like the Montreal Jazz Festival and ''Just For Laughs''.
<br />
Some [[video game]] companies also have studios in Montreal.

== Culture ==
[[File:CentrevilleMontrealété.jpg|thumb|200px|Downtown area seen from across the Saint Lawrence River]]

Montreal has many beautiful [[church]]es (Montreal is referred to locally as 'the city of a hundred churches'), including the largest church in Canada, and also many important art, history, and science museums. You can also visit the location of the 1967 [[World's Fair]], where today, as well as many other attractions, one will find the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve [[Formula One]] automobile race course. Also of interest is the site where the 1976 Summer [[Olympic Games]] were held, and the modern architecture of the Olympic stadium (the 'Big O') and its tall inclined observation tower (the highest inclined tower in the world); now a landmark of Montreal.

A lot of Montrealers are interested in [[ice hockey|hockey]], and Montreal is home to its own ice hockey team called the [[Montreal Canadiens]] who play in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL).

[[Category:Cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants]][[Image:Macadamia.jpg|thumb|Macadamia nut]]
The '''macadamia nut''' is the fruit of a [[tree]] that first came from the east [[coast]] of [[Australia]]. There is 
more than one kind of Macadamia tree. Only one kind is grown for [[food]].

The tree is an [[evergreen]] (stays green all year long). It grows up to {{convert|25|ft|abbr=off}} high. It has groups of small white [[flower]]s. It grows best in [[subtropical]] (wet and always warm) climates. It needs well-drained [[soil]] (water can flow away easily) and {{convert|40|to|100|in|mm}} of rain a year.

The nutmeat (the soft part inside the shell that can be eaten) is mostly a creamy white color. Sometimes it looks a bit yellow. It has a [[flavor]] that many people like. Macadamias are eaten [[roast]]ed (cooked) by themselves. They are used in [[cookie]]s, [[cake]]s, [[pastry|pastries]], and [[candy|candies]]. People use them like [[almond]]s and [[cashew]]s as part of cooked meals. This is an [[Far East|Oriental]] style of cooking.

The first [[Commerce|commercial]] [[orchard]] was started in Australia in the late 1880s. Commercial production started in [[Hawaii]] during the 1920s. Production later spread to [[California]], [[Mexico]], and other places with warm [[climate]].

Macadamias are [[poison]]ous to [[dog]]s. A dog usually needs 24 to 48 hours to recover fully after eating macadamias.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Treacherous Treats – Macadamia Nuts  |author= Christine Allen |work= Veterinary Technician |date= October 2001 |url= http://aspcapro.org/sites/pro/files/zj-vettech_1001_0.pdf  |accessdate= January 15, 2014 }}</ref>The plant is in the [[Proteaceae]] family of flowering plants.

[[Category:Edible nuts and seeds]]'''Maui''' is the second largest of the [[Hawaiian Islands]], in the [[United States]].
It has a population of just over 100,000 and is 727 square miles (1883 km²) in size. Maui is part of [[Maui County, Hawaii|Maui County]], [[Hawaii]]. The larger (or better known) towns include [[Kahului]], [[Wailuku]], [[Lahaina]], [[Hana]], and [[Wailea]]. Main industries are [[agriculture]] and [[tourism]].

Maui was named for the demi-god [[Maui (mythology)|Maui]]. In Hawaiian legend, he raised all the [[Hawaiian Islands|islands]] from the [[Pacific Ocean|sea]]. Maui is also known as the "Valley Isle" for the large fertile isthmus (narrow land connection) between two volcanoes.

Maui is a [[volcano|volcanic doublet]]: an island formed from two volcanic mountains that are joined together. The older volcano, [[West Maui|Mauna Kahalawai]], is much older and has been very worn down. In common talk it is called the West Maui Mountain. The larger volcano, [[Haleakala]], rises above 10,000 feet (3,050 m). The last eruption of Haleakala happened over 200 years ago, and this lava flow can be seen between Ahihi Bay and [[La Perouse Bay]] on the southeast shore. 

Other places on Maui popular with visitors include: 
*[[Iao Valley|Ī'ao Valley]].
*Haleakala crater
*Road to Hāna
*Wai'ānapanapa

Golf courses on Maui include:
*Grand Waikapu Country Club
*Ka'anapali Golf Course

[[Category:Islands of Hawaii]]'''Molokai''' (or '''Molokaʻi''') is the fifth largest [[island]] in the U.S. [[Hawaiian Islands]].  The island is 38 [[mile]]s long and 10 miles across. Its land area is 261 square miles.  The highest mountain is named [[Kamakou]], and it is 4,970 [[Foot_(unit_of_length)|feet]] (1,514 [[metre|meters]]) high. 

'Moloka'i is nicknamed "The Friendly Isle". It is one of the least developed of the Hawaiian islands.

The only big town is named [[Kaunakakai, Hawaii|Kaunakakai]], which is also the main or [[chief]] [[port]] on the island.  The [[airport]] is on West Moloka'i. Also on the island is  [[Kalaupapa]], which is a place for people who have a diease called [[leprosy]]. 

Moloka'i has many [[Hawaiian fish pond]]s along its south [[shore]]. Many of these have been cleaned and fixed.

'''Money''' is what [[people]] use to [[buy]] [[wikt:thing|things]] and [[service]]s. Money is what many people take for selling their own things or services. There are many kinds of money in the world. Most countries have their own kind of money, such as the [[United States dollar]] or the [[British]] [[Pound (currency)|pound]]. Money is also called many other names, like [[currency]] or [[cash]]. Most of the time a [[state]] or a [[government]] prints paper money and makes [[coin]]s at a [[Mint (money)|mint]].

== History of money ==
The idea of [[barter]]ing things is very old.<ref name=NOVA>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/history-money.html |title=The History of Money |author=NOVA |date=26 October 1996 |website=NOVA |publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation |accessdate=23 April 2015}}</ref> A long time ago, people did not buy or sell with money. Instead, they traded one thing for another to get what they wanted or needed.<ref name=NOVA/> One person who owned many cows could trade with another person who owned much [[wheat]]. Each would trade a little of what he had with the other. This would support the people on his farm. Other things that were easier to carry around than cows also came to be held as valuable. This gave rise to trade items such as [[jewelry]] and [[spices]]. 
  [[File:BMC 06.jpg|thumb|left|150px|{{Center|Early 6th century [[BC]] Lydian coin}}]]
When people changed from trading in things like cows and wheat to using money instead, they needed things that would last a long time. They must still have a known value, and could be carried around. The first country in the world to make metal [[coin]]s was called [[Lydia]].<ref name=BritMuseum>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/themes/money/the_origins_of_coinage.aspx |title=The origins of coinage |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Trustees of the British Museum |accessdate=23 April 2015}}</ref> These first appeared during the 7th century BC, in the western part of what is now [[Turkey]].<ref name=BritMuseum/> The Lydian coins were made of a weighed amount of precious metal and were stamped with a picture of a [[lion]]. This idea soon spread to [[Greece]], the rest of the [[Mediterranean]], and the rest of the world. Coins were all made to the same size and shape. In some parts of the world, different things have been used as money, like clam shells or blocks of salt.

Besides being easier to carry than cows, using money had many other advantages. Money is ''easier to divide'' than many trade goods. If someone own cows, and wants to trade for only "half a cow's worth" of wheat, he probably does not want to cut his cow in half. But if he sells his cow for money, and buys wheat with money, he can get exactly the amount he wants.
  
Cows die, and wheat rots. But money ''lasts longer'' than most trade goods. If someone sells a cow for money, he can save that money away until he needs it. He can always leave it to his children when he dies. It can last a very long time, and he can use it at any time.

Not every cow is as good as another cow. Some cows are sick and old, and others are healthy and young. Some wheat is good and other wheat is moldy or stale. So if a person trades cows for wheat, he might have a hard time arguing over how much wheat each cow is worth. However, money is ''standard''. That means one dollar is worth the same as another dollar. It is easier to add up and count money, than to add up the value of different cows or amounts of wheat. 

Later, after coins had been used for hundreds of years, paper money started out as a promise to pay in coin, much like an "[[I.O.U.]]" note. The first true paper money was used in [[China]] in the [[10th century]] [[AD]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archaic-jade.com/papermoney/money.htm |title=A Short History of Money |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Chinese Archaic-Jade Shop |accessdate=23 April 2015}}</ref> Paper money was also printed in [[Sweden]] between 1660 and 1664.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbbmuseum.be/2008/04/cradle-european-banknote.htm |title=The cradle of the European banknote stood in … Sweden |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Museum of the National Bank of Belgium |accessdate=23 April 2015}}</ref> Both times, it did not work well, and had to be stopped because the banks kept running out of coins to pay on the notes. [[Massachusetts]] [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Bay Colony]] printed paper money in the [[1690s]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/02/the-first-paper-money-in-america-was-issued-on-this-day-in-1690/70718/ |title=The First Paper Money in America Was Issued on This Day in 1690 |author=Rebecca Greenfield |date=3 February 2011 |website=The Atlantic |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group |accessdate=23 April 2015}}</ref> This time, the use became more common.

Today, most of what people think of as money is not even things you can hold. It is numbers in [[Deposit account|bank accounts]], saved in computer memories.  Many people still feel more comfortable using coins and paper, and do not totally trust using [[electronic money]] on a [[computer memory]].

== Kinds of money ==
 [[File:US-$10000-Certificate of Deposit-1875 (Proof).jpg|thumb|right|250px|{{Center|US-$10,000 Certificate of Deposit, 1875}}]]
Many types of money have been used at different times in history. These are:
* [[Cowry]] shells
* [[Commodity]] money
* [[Convertible]] paper money
* [[Inconvertible]] money
* Bank deposits
* [[Online|Electronic]] money

''Commodity money'' can be used for other purposes besides serving as a medium of exchange. We say it possesses intrinsic value, because it is useful or valuable by itself. Some examples of commodity money are [[cattle]], [[silk]], [[gold]] and [[silver]]. Convertible paper money is money that is convertible into gold and silver. Gold and Silver [[certificate]]s are convertible paper money as they can be fully convertible into gold and silver. 

Inconvertible money is money that cannot be converted into gold and silver. Notes and coins are inconvertible money. They are inconvertible and are declared by the [[government]] money. Such [[fiat money]] is a country's [[legal tender]]. Today, notes and coins are the [[currency|currencies]] used in bank deposits. 

Types of bank deposits:
* [[Demand]] deposits
* [[Savings]] deposits
* [[Time deposit]]s
* Negotiable certificate

'''Multiplication''' is an [[arithmetic]] operation for finding the ''[[Product (mathematics)|product]]'' of two [[number]]s.
Multiplication is the third operation in maths after addition which is the first, subtraction which is the second and then there is multiplication.

With [[natural number]]s, it tells you the number of tiles in a [[rectangle]] where one of the two numbers equals the number of tiles on one side and the other number equals the number of tiles on the other side.

With [[real number]]s, it tells you the [[area]] of a [[rectangle]] where the first number equals the size of one side and the second number equals the size of the other side.

For example, three multiplied by five is the [[wikt:total|total]] of five threes [[addition|added]] together, or the total of three fives. This can be written down as 3 × 5 = 15, or spoken as "three times five equals fifteen." [[Mathematics|Mathematicians]] call the two numbers you wish to multiply "coefficients" together, or ''"multiplicand"'' and ''"multiplicator"'' separately. Multiplicand × multiplicator = product.

Multiplication between numbers is said to be commutative- when the order of the numbers does not influence the value of the product. This is true for the [[Integer]]s (whole numbers), e.g. 4 × 6 is the same as 6 × 4, and also for the [[Rational number]]s (fractions), and for all the other Real numbers (representable as a field in the continuous line), and also for [[Complex number]]s (numbers representable as a field in the plane). It is not true for [[quaternion]]s (numbers representable as a ring in the four-dimensional space), [[vector]]s or [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].
[[File:Multiplication as scaling integers.gif|thumb|245x245px]]
The definition of multiplication as repeated addition provides a way to arrive at a set-theoretic interpretation of multiplication of [[cardinal numbers]]. A more accurate representation is to think of it as scaling quantities. This animation illustrates 3 being multiplied by 2, giving 6 as a result. Notice that the blue dot in the blue segment of length 3 is placed at position 1, and the blue segment is scaled so that this dot is placed at the end of the red segment, of length 2. For multiplication by any X, the blue dot will always start at 1 and end at X. This works even for X smaller than 1, or negative.

The opposite of multiplication is [[Division (mathematics)|division]].

'''Microsoft Corporation''' ([[NASDAQ]]:[http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/msft MSFT]) is a [[company]] that makes computer [[software]] and [[video game]]s for users around the world. [[Bill Gates]] and [[Paul Allen]] founded the company in 1975.<ref name="bbc-timeline">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5085630.stm|title=Bill Gates: A timeline|work=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2006-06-15|accessdate=2008-08-18}}</ref> Microsoft makes [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Microsoft Office]] (including [[Microsoft Word]]), [[Microsoft Edge|Edge]], [[MSN]] and the [[Xbox One]], among others. Most Microsoft [[computer program|programs]] cannot be [[download|downloaded]] for free - people have to buy them in a shop or online. Some products (like the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] [[operating system]]) are often already installed when people buy a new [[computer]].

== Software ==
[[Microsoft Windows]] is an [[operating system]], which means that it is the basic software that makes people's computers work and lets other programs work.  The majority of desktop and [[laptop]] computers run Windows, and so do some [[tablet computer]]s and a few [[smartphone]]s. The latest version of Windows is [[Windows 10]]. 

[[Microsoft Office]] is an [[office suite]].  It lets people write documents on their computer with [[Microsoft Word]], make charts and graphs with [[Microsoft Excel]] and make presentations with [[Microsoft PowerPoint]].

[[Internet Explorer]] is a piece of software that lets people look at things online (known as [[web browser|browsing]]) and download things from the [[Internet]]. 

Microsoft also makes other programs for the Internet.  Many of them are called [[Windows Live]] services, with the name Windows Live put in front of the old name of the service, like Windows Live [[Hotmail]], which is an email service. However, the Windows Live name is not being used much anymore. Microsoft runs a service called [[Bing]] on the internet which lets people [[Search engine|search for things]] like [[photography|photos]] or information online.

[[MS-DOS]] is the first existing operating system developed by Microsoft, used for primitive computers and terminals.

[[Microsoft Sharepoint]] is a server tool included in Microsoft Office (2007, 2013).
Microsoft Expression series is a web development tool which is now discontinued.
[[Minecraft]] and many other programs have been bought by Microsoft and developed further.

== Services and hardware ==
[[Skype]] is also a service by Microsoft. It was not started by Microsoft, but was later purchased by Microsoft. Skype is a free program that lets people call other people, either through the [[telephone]], or through Skype on the other person's computer.

The [[Xbox]], the [[Xbox 360]] and the new [[Xbox One]] are [[video game consoles]], which means they let people play video games when connected to their [[television]]s. Microsoft is one of the three big companies that make video game consoles. The other two are [[Nintendo]] and [[Sony]]. [[Xbox Live]] is a service that lets people play online against other people anywhere in the world. Microsoft also makes many [[personal computer|PC]] games.

Microsoft also has many other small products such as [[tablet computer]]s and computer peripherals including [[Computer mouse|mice]] and [[computer keyboard|keyboards]] that are used with computers. The Microsoft Surface is an example, which is a laptop/tablet convertible.

[[File:OIC Member States.png|230px|thumbnail|right|The map showing the Counties who cooperate in Islamic community organisation]]
The '''Islamic World''' consists of all people who are in [[Islam]]. It is not an exact location, but rather a [[community]]. When they do things together as Muslims, they are the "[[umma]]", which means "community" referring to all of the believers. The faith emphasizes unity and defense of fellow Muslims, so it is common for these nations to cooperate. [[Recent conflicts in the Muslim World]] have sometimes spread because of this desire to cooperate (see below). It is also likely that some have been made shorter and less damaging because of it. Some might even have never started.

== Demographics ==
Muslims are in many countries. In 52 nations, Muslims are the majority. Almost all are [[Sunni]]. They speak about 60 languages and come from all ethnic backgrounds. 

* 10.4 million Muslims in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]
* 2.2 million Muslims in [[Latin America|Latin]] and [[Central America]]
* 10.0 million Muslims in the [[European Union]] plus [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and [[Albania]]
* few or none in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Norway]]
* 62.4 million Muslims in [[Turkey]]
* 284.4 million Muslims in the [[Arab League]] including [[Iraq]] (with about 15 million [[Shia]], 60% of the population)
* 254.0 Muslims in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]
* 65.4 million Muslims (90% [[Shia]]) in [[Iran]]
* 48.5 million Muslims in [[Central Asia]] - in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Uzebekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]] - formerly [[republics of the Soviet Union]].
* 26.7 million Muslims in [[Russia]]
* 22.7 million Muslims in [[Afghanistan]]
* 230.0 million Muslims in [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]] (formerly [[Bangladesh#History|East Bengal]] provincial region).
* 133.3 million Muslims in [[Republic of India]] (included [[Jammu and Kashmir]]) - the world's largest minority population
* 133.1 million Muslims in [[China]] - a close second
34.6 million Muslims in Somalia
* 196.3 million Muslims in [[Indonesia]]
* 30.0 million Muslims in the rest of [[South-East Asia]], especially [[Malaysia]]
* few or none in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Mongolia, or the South Pacific

* 1.5 billion people total

== Media ==
The ''[[Al-Jazeera]]'' satellite TV network in the [[Arabic language]] is a news source many Muslims watch.

In most Muslim nations, the government is the main source of news. This sometimes makes it very difficult or dangerous to make anti-government statements.

There are, however, many other news programmes and websites in the Muslim world.

== Islam in law and ethics ==
[[Islamic law]] exists in many variations - in Arabic it is called [[shariah]] - five schools of which were created centuries ago. These are the [[classical fiqh]]: the [[Hanafi]] school from [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangaladesh]], [[West Africa]], [[Egypt]], the [[Maliki]] in [[North Africa]] and [[West Africa]], the [[Shafi]] in [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], the [[Hanbali]] in [[Arabia]], and [[Jaferi]] in [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]] - where the majority is [[Shia]]. All five are very old and many Muslims feel a new fiqh must be created for modern [[society]]. Islam has a method for doing this, [[al-urf]] and [[ijtihad]] are the words to describe this method, but they have not been used in a long time, and few people are trusted enough to use them to make new laws.

So, in most of the Muslim world, people are very conservative, especially about [[alcohol]], [[adultery]], [[abortion]] and [[women]] working in jobs where they are used to lure customers.

[[Muslim women]] often dress extremely modestly, and many do so by choice. But in some countries they have been forced to do so against their will. This is one of the things that causes tension between the [[Western World]] and that of Muslims.

[[Islamic economics]] bans [[debt]] but in most Muslim countries Western [[banking]] is allowed. This is another issue that many Muslims have with the Western world.

== Islam in politics ==
One quarter of the [[world]] population share Islam as an [[ethical tradition]]. 

Many people in these countries also see [[Islam as a political movement]]. In democratic countries there is usually at least one [[Islamic party]].

[[Political Islam]] is powerful in all Muslim-majority countries. [[Islamic parties]] in [[Pakistan]] and [[Algeria]] have taken power. 

Many in these movements call themselves [[Islamist]]s, which also sometimes describes more [[militant Islam]]ic groups. The relationships between these groups and their views of democracy are complex.

Some of these groups are called [[terrorist]]s because they attack civilians of other non-Muslim nations, to make a political point.

== Conflicts with Israel and the US ==
[[Israel]] is very unpopular in the Muslim world, because of the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]] and the way that the state of Israel came into being in [[1948]] which many [[Arab]]s thought was unfair.

Some Muslims see this as a fight against [[Judaism]] or [[Jew]]s, but not all. In [[Morocco]] for instance, the Islamists recently invited [[Jew]]s to join the party. Jewish groups also cooperate with Arabs in the [[West Bank]], where [[Neturei Karta]] (anti-Zionist orthodox Jewish) leader Rabbi [[Mosche Hirsch]] served as the Minister for Jewish Affairs in the [[Fatah]] before there was a [[Palestinian Authority]]. Like the Arabs, this small group of Jews thought the way Israel was created was not right. However, very few Jews believe this, and most support Israel as a state.

In [[1979]] there was a big shift in the way the Muslim world dealt with the rest of the world. In that year, [[Egypt]] made peace with [[Israel]], [[Iran]] became an [[Islamic state]] after a [[revolution]], and there was an [[1979 invasion of Afghanistan|invasion of Afghanistan]] by the [[Soviet Union]]. A lot of things changed in that year. By [[2001]] the [[Soviet Union]] was gone, [[Jordan]] had also made peace with Israel, and on [[September 11, 2001]] there were major attacks on the U.S. - which most people believe were made to drive the United States out of the Muslim world, especially [[Saudi Arabia]]. In many ways the events of 1979 led to the events of 2001.

The [[2001 invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] are called part of a [[War on Terrorism]] by the [[United States]]. Many or most Muslims see it as a [[War on Islam]]. After the invasion, the [[Islamic parties]] won more seats, and a majority of Muslims polled in many nations expressed support for [[Osama bin Laden]] and said he would "do the right thing". [[Olivier Roy]] is a French scholar who thinks that this does not express support for [[al-Qaeda]] or [[militant Islam]] but opposing [[colonialism]] and what many Muslims call [[racism]] - favourable treatment for Jews especially those living in [[West Bank settlement]]s, many of whom have American or British passport, and which the [[United Nations]] says have no right to live there.

The situation is very complicated and there are many different views of it.

== Organization ==
The [[Organization of Islamic Conference]] formed in [[1969]] lets the Muslim nations work as a group. [[Russia]] joined in [[2003]].

The [[Arab League]] is a smaller group of only the Arab countries.

[[OPEC]] is another forum where issues between the Muslim and non-Muslim world come up. In [[1973]] to protest U.S. support for Israel there was an [[1973 oil embargo|oil embargo]] which caused the [[1973 energy crisis]].

[[Category:Islam|World]]{{Cosmology}}
A '''multiverse''' (or meta-universe) is the [[theory]] of a [[set]] of multiple possible [[universe]]s, including our [[universe]], which make up [[reality]]. These universes are sometimes called '''[[parallel universe]]s'''. A number of different versions have been considered. They all have the same weakness: there is no known way these ideas can be tested.

You can think of universes as "bubbles". When two of these "bubbles" collide they may have caused the big bang. They can also separate to form two smaller universes.

The term "multiverse" was [[wikt:coin#verb|coined]] by psychologist [[William James]].<ref>James, William 1895. ''The Will to Believe'', and earlier in 1895, as cited in [[OED]]'s new 2003 entry for "multiverse": 1895 W. JAMES in ''International Journal of Ethics'' '''6''' p10. "Visible nature is all plasticity and indifference, a multiverse, as one might call it, and not a universe".</ref>

{{original research|date=May 2014}}
The '''mechanistic paradigm''', also known as the Newtonian paradigm, assumes that things in the [[environment]] around [[human]]s are more like [[machine]]s than like [[life]].  It was more common in the [[19th century]].  This is a set of loosely related beliefs that affects all [[sciences]]:

*In [[physics]] it presents [[atom]]s as made of [[particle physics|particles]] in preference to say the [[wave theory of light]].  In fact, both the particle and wave view are required to explain everything light does, but are rarely presented as equals.  Many physics students graduate fully understanding the [[hydrogen bomb]] but having no clear idea of how [[musical instrument]]s work.
*In [[astrophysics]] it assumes that the [[universe]] is like [[clockwork]] and works on its own without our choice making any difference - this fits [[relativity]] but is not easy to combine with [[quantum mechanics]].
*In [[cosmology]] it accepts [[models of our universe]] more easily if reject the [[continuous creation]] of [[matter]], [[energy]] or any new "other universes".
*In [[chemistry]] it assumes that [[molecule]]s are like [[building block]]s, and have no unpredictable or strange and unique effects when combined.  This is the basic assumption of [[mechanosynthesis]] which some scientists think will create a [[molecular assembler]].
*In [[biology]] it assumes that everything about life - all of [[biochemistry]] - is predictable from [[chemistry]] and [[physics]].
*Believers tend to regard [[ecology]] and [[psychology]] as "less scientific" than [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]].
*Believers may reject ideas like [[psychoneuroimmunology]], [[Gaia philosophy]] or [[Fecund universes]] for no scientific reason, simply because these theories assume "higher level phenomena" sometimes drive lower levels.
*[[Greedy Reductionism]] may be more likely among believers in mechanistic ideas.  For instance, they may want to always see things as made of smaller, even invisible, parts that no one can see or prove is real - like in [[string theory]].
*For this reason, when they work in [[psychology]], they may prefer theories like [[behaviorism]] that deny [[free will]] and try to explain [[human behaviour]] as a function of [[biology]].
*The [[philosophy of mathematics]] of most believers is a form of [[Platonism]].  This assumes there is a perfect or [[ideal form]] that theories only approximate.  This lets them explain inaccuracies in mechanistic theories as being due to an imperfection in human ability to reason, instead of imperfections in math itself.

Believers in this paradigm sometimes say that those who do not believe in it are following a '''cognitive paradigm''' - but almost no one uses this term, since it is [[redundant]] - [[cognitive science]] is already accepted as the most basic idea in the [[philosophy of science]].  But mechanists reject some of the ideas of cognitive scientists, like [[cognitive science of mathematics]].

Mechanistic thinking also assumes that [[philosophy of perception]] is much less important than cognitive scientists say it is - that humans and their beliefs and equipment do not generally add a lot of [[bias]] to a scientific theory.  [[Thomas Kuhn]] said otherwise, that these things matter, and that the major assumptions of science, can shift drastically.  This he called a '''paradigm shift'''.  The shift from mechanistic to cognitive paradigm is an example of this.
Later he used other words to describe the assumptions and beliefs, like [[mind-set]], but the word "paradigm" is still used.  Some say it is much over-used.

[[Economics]] is often said to "suffer from" assumptions of the mechanistic paradigm.  Sometimes those who believe in [[neoclassical economics]] and also in the mechanistic paradigm say they "seek to unify physics and economics," as if people and particles behaved as two examples of the same kind of thing.

[[Technology]] is often easier to make if people accept a mechanistic paradigm - but it may be harder to say why it does not work, if one believes in these ideas.  For instance, [[creating]] [[diagnostic tree]]s might be easier if one works from [[experience]], not from an idea of how a technology should or must work.

A controversial idea is that mechanistic ideas are just an older idea called [[scholasticism]], with more [[mathematics]].  Both tried to work from what should or must be, instead of what [[experiment]] seemed to show.

Another controversial idea is that [[scientism]], belief in science as if it were a [[religion]] or [[ethical tradition]], comes from this paradigm.  Most scientists who are mechanistic do not say they see science as a guide to [[ethics]], but try to keep them separate.

'''MediaWiki''' is the name of the [[software]] that runs all of the [[Wikimedia]] projects.  MediaWiki was released in 2003.  It is free server-based software which is licensed under the [[GNU]] General Public License (GPL).  The software is licensed under the [[GPL]]. This means it is [[free content]], or [[open source]].

MediaWiki is designed to be run on a large [[web server]] farm for a website that gets millions of hits per day.  MediaWiki is a very powerful, scalable software and a feature-rich wiki implementation, that uses [[PHP]] to process and display data stored in its [[MySQL]] database.  Pages use MediaWiki's [[Wikitext]] format, so that users without knowledge of [[XHTML]] or [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] can edit them easily.

When a user submits an edit to a page, MediaWiki writes it to the database, but without deleting the previous versions of the page, thus allowing easy reverts in case of vandalism or spamming. MediaWiki can manage image and multimedia files, too, which are stored in the filesystem. For large wikis with lots of users, MediaWiki supports [[caching]] and can be easily coupled with Squid proxy server software.

All Wikimedia projects run on MediaWiki version  {{CURRENTVERSION}}.<ref>[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Version Meta wiki's version page]</ref>

== Usage ==

As MediaWiki is more flexible, therefore many websites use MediaWiki rather than other types of wiki software. Besides Wikimedia, [[Wikia]] is also another company that uses MediaWiki greatly for people to contribute information.

There are also some websites that uses MediaWiki as a content management system.<ref>[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Sites_using_MediaWiki/corporate Sites using MediaWiki for corporations]</ref>

== Extensions ==
In MediaWiki, a system administrator can choose to install extensions which are provided on the main MediaWiki website. Some are from the MediaWiki developers, while others are from programmers from all around the world.

Most extensions can be download from Wikimedia's [[subversion (software)|Subversion]] repository. However, there are some other extensions that other people host themselves.

Some extensions had been added to the main software along the development of MediaWiki.<ref>[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Category:Obsolete_extensions MediaWiki's category of extensions that became part of the software]</ref> For example, the [[mw:Extension:+sysop|Makesysop]] extension is an extension to promote a user into an administrator or a bureaucrat.

There were a total of 2124 extensions as of October 4, 2013.<ref>[[mediawikiwiki:Extension_Matrix|MediaWiki's Extension matrix, displaying 2000 out of '''2124''' members of Category:Extensions]]</ref>

== Namespaces ==
In the default installation of MediaWiki, the software has 17 namespaces<ref name="Namespace">[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Namespace MediaWiki helppage on namespaces]</ref>(18 actually, but one does not have a namespace), namely:
* Article (No namespace, like this page)
* Talk - for main namespace talk page
* User - the user page, also from [[Special:MyPage]]
* User talk - the user talk page, also from [[Special:MyTalk]]
* Project - The project namespace(like on this wiki, is Wikipedia)
* Project talk - The project page talk page
* File - Page for images and sounds
* File talk - Talk about the media
* MediaWiki - Software pages, can only be changed from an administrator
* MediaWiki talk - Talk about the software page, anyone can write in this namespace
* Template - for templates
* Template talk - talk about the template
* Help - Help pages(like [[Help:Contents]])
* Help talk - talk about the help page
* Category - Categorising pages
* Category talk - talk about the category
* Special - Special pages of the MediaWiki software
* Media - Namespace to directly link to the file

Additional namespaces can be added using the [[mw:Manual:LocalSettings.php|settings file]] from the installation of MediaWiki.<ref>[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Using_custom_namespaces MediaWiki's guide on making custom namespaces]</ref>

== Bugs ==
As MediaWiki is a complex software, there would always be bugs in the software, especially for new extensions. Therefore, Wikimedia has created a [[bugzilla]] website for people who see a bug to tell the developers of MediaWiki.

Some extensions of MediaWiki use the [[mediazilla:|Wikimedia Bugzilla]], while some just use the talk pages of the extension page.

== Skins ==
[[File:VectorNavigation-en.png|thumb|300px|The vector skin on English Wikipedia.]]
During the development of MediaWiki, different skins have come into the main software. For example, Wikipedia used to be using Nostalgia.<ref>[http://nostalgia.wikipedia.org Wikipedia site that uses Nostalgia]</ref> But it changed to Monobook before the new Vector skin came up in 1.16.<ref>[http://blog.wikimedia.org/blog/2010/05/13/a-new-look-for-wikipedia/ Blog post on Wikimedia's blog about the vector skin.]</ref>

A survey done by Wikimedia showed that more people prefer the Vector skin.

It is possible to change the skin that a user wants to see a wiki as by going to their [[Special:Preferences|preferences]].

[[Category:Wikimedia]][[File:Ana Dili.JPG|thumb|200px|The monument for the Mother ([[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]) tongue in [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], [[Azerbaijan]]]]
A '''first language''' (also '''mother tongue''', '''native language''', '''arterial language''', or '''L1''') is the language a person first learns.<ref>Bloomfield, Leonard. [http://books.google.com/books?id=Gfrd-On5iFwC&dq Language] ISBN 81-208-1196-8</ref> A person's first language helps them understand words and concepts in the style of that first language.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=JeTwQB5doD4C&dq Alan Davies. The native speaker: myth and reality.] ISBN 1-85359-622-1</ref>

Sometimes ''first language'' means the language a person speaks best (his [[second language]] is the language he speaks less well than his first language, etc.).  In this case ''first language'', ''second language'' and ''third language'' show how well one speaks a language, so a person can have more than one first language or second language.

[[Category:Language]]The hair that grows on the upper [[lip]] of some men is called a '''mustache'''. The hair that grows on the sides of the [[face]] and the [[chin]] of some men is called a [[beard]]. Some men have a lot of hair and a big mustache, and some have very little. In the modern world, many men [[shave]] part or all of their mustaches, or cut their mustache so it does not get very long. A chin [[beard]] with no mustache is called a [[goatee]], whilst a chin [[beard]] with a mustache is known as a Van Dyke.

Mustache in [[United Kingdom]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations]] is spelled moustache.

Some [[animal]]s such as [[walrus]]es also have hair like this, and people sometimes also call this hair a mustache.

[[Category:Facial hair]]A '''mile''' is a unit of length. There are many different kinds of mile but ''mile'' on its own usually means the ''statute'' mile.  

==Statute mile== 
In the [[United States|US]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] the word ''mile'' usually means the statute mile.

==Nautical mile==
The nautical mile is used for sea or air travel. 

The nautical mile was originally defined as one minute of arc along a line of [[longitude]] of the Earth.  There are 60 minutes of arc in one degree or arc (60'&nbsp;=&nbsp;1°). So there were 10,800 nautical miles from the North Pole to the South Pole.

Now the nautical mile is defined as 1,852 [[metre]]s.

|-
|1 nautical mile||= 1,852 [[metre]]s (by definition)

|||≈ {{formatnum:{{#expr:1852/0.3048round0}}}} feet
|-
|||≈ {{#expr:1.852/1.609344round3}} statute miles
|}
The speed of a ship that travels one nautical mile in one hour is called one [[Knot (speed)|knot]]
==Roman mile==
The mile was first used by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s.  It comes from the [[Latin]] phrase ''mille passus'' (plural: ''milia passuum'').  This means "one thousand paces". A pace is the distance each foot moves when taking one step.

:{|
|-
|1 Roman mile||= 1,000 Roman paces (by definition)
|-
|||≈ 1,479 metres
|-
|||≈ 4,852 feet
|}

==Other miles==
Different miles have been used throughout history in various parts of the world. In Norway and Sweden, for example, a mil is a unit of length which is equal to 10 kilometres.

'''Margarine''' is an [[wikt:artificial|artificial]] [[butter]]. It can be made from [[vegetable oil]], or [[animal fat]]. It may also contain [[skimmed milk]], [[table salt|salt]] and emulsifiers. Margarine is used in many baked products. It contains less [[fat]] than butter, so is often chosen instead of it. There are also "low fat" margarines, which contain even less fat. However, many types of margarine contain [[trans fat]]s, which are unhealthy and can cause [[heart disease]]. Other vegetables fats, like olive oil, are a better choice for cooking.

The Milky Way has a [[diameter]] of 100,000 [[light year]]s,<ref name="seds" /> and is a [[barred spiral galaxy]]. The discovery of the Milky Way goes back to the [[Ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Democritus]].<ref name="space" />  The Milky Way has three main parts:  a ''disk'', in which the Solar System resides, a ''bulge'' at the core, and an all encompassing ''halo''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/gr/public/gal_milky.html|title=Our own Galaxy - the Milky Way|publisher=University of Cambridge|date=1996|accessdate=2012-11-12}}</ref>

This galaxy belongs to the [[Local Group]] of three large galaxies and over 50 smaller galaxies. The Milky Way is one of the largest galaxies in the group, second to the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].<ref name="seds" /> Milky Way's closest [[neighbour]] is [[Canis Major Dwarf]], which is about 25,000 light years away from the [[Earth]].

The stellar disc of the Milky Way does not have a sharp edge, a radius beyond which there are no stars. Rather, the number of stars drops smoothly with distance from the centre of the Galaxy. Beyond a radius of about 40,000 light years, the number of stars drops much faster, for reasons that are not understood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3857 |title=[0909.3857&#93; The structure of the outer galactic disc as revealed by IPHAS early A stars |publisher=Arxiv.org |date=2009|accessdate=2010-08-10}}</ref>

'''Movement''', or '''motion''',  is the [[state]] of changing something's [[position]]—that is, changing where something is.  A flying [[bird]] or a walking [[person]] are '''moving''', because they change where they are from one place to another.  There are many kinds of [[science]] and [[mathematics|math]] related to movement.

For example, thanks to [[Albert Einstein]], we know that all ''position'' is [[relativity|relative]].  This means that everything's position depends on where they exist in relation to other things.  For example, a ball is 5 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]] away from a [[box]], 3 feet away from a [[chair]], and a foot away from a [[Table (furniture)|table]].  According to Einstein, the ball's position means how far the ball is from other things, so by telling you how far the ball was from other things, I told you its position.  An object's ''movement'' is also relative.  Its movement depends on where it is in relation to other things and where it's going to in relation to other things.

There are many things involved in movement, such as [[speed]], [[velocity]], [[acceleration]], [[gravity]], magnetic [[electromagnetism|attraction]] and [[repulsion]], [[friction]], and [[inertia]].  Also, [[Work (physics)|work]] is needed to produce movement. [[Light]] moves at about 300,000 [[kilometer|kilometres]] per second or 186,000 [[mile]]s per second.

== Control of movement ==
In all animals, movement is controlled by the [[nervous system]], especially the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]]. 

The muscles that control the eye are driven by the [[optic tectum]] in the midbrain. All the [[voluntary muscle]]s in the body are driven by [[motor neuron]]s in the spinal cord and hindbrain.<ref name="Kandel 2000"/><!--Ch 34--> Spinal motor neurons are controlled by neural circuits of the spinal cord, and by inputs from the brain. The spinal circuits do many [[reflex]] responses, and also do rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain give more sophisticated control.<ref name="Kandel 2000">Kandel, Eric R; Schwartz, James Harris & Jessell, Thomas M. 2000. ''Principles of neural science''. New York: McGraw-Hill. ISBN 978-0-8385-7701-1 []</ref><!--Ch. 36 and 37-->

The brain has several motor areas that project directly to the spinal cord. At the highest level is the [[primary motor cortex]], a strip of tissue at the back edge of the frontal lobe. This tissue sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the [[pyramidal tract]]. This allows for precise voluntary control of the fine details of movements. There are other brain areas which affect movement. Among the most important secondary areas are the [[premotor cortex]], [[basal ganglia]], and [[cerebellum]].<ref name="Kandel 2000"/><!--Ch. 33-->

|}

In addition to all of the above, the brain and spinal cord contain extensive circuitry to control the [[autonomic nervous system]], which works by secreting hormones and by modulating the "smooth" muscles of the gut.<ref name="Kandel 2000"/><!--ch49--> The autonomic nervous system affects [[heart rate]], [[digestion]], [[respiration]] rate, [[salivation]], [[perspiration]], [[urination]], and [[sexual arousal]], and several other processes. Most of its functions are not under direct voluntary control.

[[Category:Mechanics]]'''Metaphor'''  is a term for a [[figure of speech]].<ref>[http://rhetoric.byu.edu "Metaphor" at Rhetoric.byu.edu]; retrieved 2012-1-14.</ref> It does not use a word in its basic literal sense. Instead, it uses a word in a kind of comparison. We run, and we also say rivers run. We may run into trouble, especially if we run up a bill at the bar.  

So a metaphor uses words to make a picture in our mind. It takes a word from its original [[context]], and uses it in another.
:"I beat him with a stick" = literal meaning of 'beat'.
:"I beat him in an argument" = metaphorical meaning of 'beat'.

Metaphors are an essential part of language: it is not possible to speak or write without them.<ref>McArthur, Tom 1992. ''The Oxford companion to the English language''. Oxford University Press. Metaphor, p653, especially section 'The universality of metaphor', p654. ISBN 0-19-214183-X </ref><ref>Lakoff G & Johnson M. 1980, 2003. ''The metaphors we live by''. University of Chicago Press. ISBN 978-0-226-46800-6</ref> A simple example is the word "run". This has a basic meaning of "moving quickly" or "go with quick steps on alternate feet, never having both feet on the ground at the same time".<ref>Concise Oxford Dictionary, 9th ed.</ref> The ''Concise Oxford Dictionary'' then gives 
34 other uses as a verb; 21 uses as a noun; about 50 uses in short phrases. All of these are metaphors, although we do not usually notice this.  

We use metaphors to make ''indirect'' [[:wikt:comparison|comparisons]], but without using '[[like]]' or '[[as]]' – because that would be a [[simile]]. A simile is a ''direct'' comparison: "Jane is like a child".

A metaphor very often uses the [[verb]] '[[to be]]': "love ''is'' war", for example, not "love ''is like'' war" (that is a simile).
[[Poetry]] includes much metaphor, usually more than [[prose]].

[[Spam]] is an example that any [[email]] user knows about – this word was originally a metaphor, from 'Spam', a type of canned meat. [[Server]]s putting unwanted email into somebody's inbox was similar to waiters putting unwanted Spam into food.  This was originally suggested by a [[Monty Python]] scene. When we use a metaphor very often and we forget the old meaning, or forget that the two meanings are connected, this is a 'dead metaphor'.

Originally ''metaphor'' was a [[Greece|Greek]] word for 'transfer'. It came from ''meta'' ('beyond') and ''pherein'' ('carry'). So the word ''metaphor'' in English was a metaphor, too. Today in Greek, ''metaphor'' is a [[trolley]] (a thing that is pushed for carrying shopping or bags).

*Most metaphors are concepts:  see [[conceptual metaphor]].

*[[Idiom]]s use metaphors, or are metaphors: for example, the [[English language|English]] phrase ''to kick the bucket'' means ''to [[death|die]]''.

== Simple metaphors ==
=== Description ===

A simple metaphor has a single link between the subject and the metaphoric vehicle. The vehicle thus has a single meaning which is transferred directly to the subject.

=== Examples ===
*Cool down! [Cool = temperature]
*He was mad. [mad = anger]
*I'll chew on it. [chew = think]
*It was raining cats and dogs. [cats and dogs = rain]
*Max was an angel. [angel = lovely person]
In the simple metaphor, the effort to understand what the author or speaker intends is relatively low, and hence it may easily be used with a wider and less sophisticated audience.

== Complex metaphors ==
=== Description ===
A complex metaphor happens where a simple metaphor is based on a secondary metaphoric element. For example using a metaphor of 'light' for 'understanding' may be complexified by saying 'throwing light' rather than 'shining light'. 'Throwing' is an extra metaphor for how light arrives. 

=== Examples ===
*That lends weight to the argument.
*They stood alone, frozen statues on the plain.
*The ball happily danced into the net.
*"But at my back I always hear / <br/>Time's wingèd chariot hurrying near / <br>And yonder all before us lie / <br>Deserts of vast eternity".<br>From 17th century English poet [[Andrew Marvell]]'s poem ''To His Coy Mistress''.

== Compound metaphors ==
=== Description ===
A compound metaphor is one where there are multiple parts in the metaphor that are used to snag the listener. These parts may be enhancement words such as adverbs, adjectives, etc.

Each part in the compound metaphor may be used to signify an additional item of meaning.

=== Examples ===
*Thick, primal, blind fog descended before his eyes.
*The car screeched in hated anguish, its flesh laid bare in the raucous collision.

Compound metaphors are like a multiple punch, hitting the listener repeatedly with metaphoric elements. Where the complex metaphor uses stacked layers to enhance the metaphor, the compound metaphor uses sequential words. The compound metaphor is also known as a loose metaphor.

== Live and dead metaphors ==
A live metaphor is one which a reader notices. A dead metaphor is one no-one notices because it has become so common in the language. 

=== Examples ===
Two people walk off a tennis court. Someone asks the loser: "What happened?".
*''"He won"''. Literal truth.
*''"He beat me"''. Obviously a dead metaphor.
*''"He thrashed me"''. This one is slightly alive.

*''The river runs''. Dead, and many variations on this theme.
*''Electricity is a fluid''. Nearly dead.
*''All our efforts are running into the sand''. Live.

'''Metabolism''' is the name given to the [[chemical reaction]]s which keep us alive. It happens in the cells of living [[organisms]].

Reactions [[catalysis|catalyzed]] by [[enzyme]]s allow organisms to grow, reproduce, maintain their structures, and respond to their environments. The word ‘metabolism’ can also refer to [[digestion]] and the transport of substances into and between different cells.

Metabolism is usually divided into two categories. [[Catabolism]] breaks down organic matter and harvests energy by way of [[cellular respiration]]. [[Anabolism]] uses energy to construct [[molecules]] such as [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s.

The chemical reactions of metabolism are organized into metabolic pathways, or cycles, like the [[Krebs cycle]]. One chemical is transformed through a series of steps into another chemical by a series of enzymes.

The metabolic system of an organism decides which substances it finds [[nutrition|nutritious]] and which [[poison]]ous. For example, some [[prokaryote]]s use [[hydrogen sulfide]] as a nutrient, yet this gas is poisonous to animals.<ref name="Physiology1">{{cite journal |author=Friedrich C. |title=Physiology and genetics of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria |journal=Adv Microb Physiol |volume=39 |issue= |pages=235–89 |year=1998 |pmid=9328649 |doi=10.1016/S0065-2911(08)60018-1 |series=Advances in Microbial Physiology |isbn=9780120277391}}</ref> The speed of metabolism, the [[metabolic rate]], influences how much food an organism will need, and how it is able to get that food.

[[Category:Metabolism| ]][[File:Microscope.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[1915]] Bausch and Lomb [[Light microscope]]]]
[[File:Microscope-IMG 0518.jpg|right|thumb|Electron microscope]]

A '''microscope''' is a [[science|scientific]] [[tool|instrument]]. It makes things normally too small to be seen look larger. This way they can be seen better and examined correctly. People who use microscopes commonly in their jobs include [[Medical doctor|doctors]] and [[scientist]]s. Microscopes are commonly used in schools to help students in science classes such as [[biology]] or [[chemistry]].

The earliest microscopes had only one [[Lens (optics)|lens]] and are called ''simple microscopes''. ''Compound microscopes'' have at least two lenses. In a compound microscope, the lens closer to the eye is called the ''eyepiece''. The lens at the other end is called the ''objective''.

Microscopes make things seem larger than they are, to about 1000 times larger. This is much stronger than any [[magnifying glass]].

== Types of microscopes ==
There are many different types of microscopes. The most common are compound [[light microscope]]s and [[electron microscopes]]. In a compound light microscope, the object is illuminated: light is thrown on it. The image formed by the object is looked at. Light passes through two lenses and makes the image bigger. 

[[Electron microscope]]s come in different types. [[electron microscope#Transmission electron microscopes (TEM)|Transmission electron microscopes]] (TEMs) fire [[electron]]s into the object being looked at. This carries information about how the object looks into a magnetic "lens". The image is then magnified onto a [[television screen]]. [[Scanning electron microscope]]s also fire electrons at the object, but in a single beam. These lose their power when they strike the object, and the loss of power results in something else being generated—usually an [[X-ray]]. This is sensed and magnified onto a screen.

[[Category:Microscopes| ]]{{otheruses}}
The '''mass''' of an object is a [[measure]] of an object's resistance to [[acceleration]], sometimes also called "inertia". A mountain has typically more mass than a rock, for instance. Mass should not be confused with the related but quite different concept of [[weight]]. A large mass like the Earth will attract a small mass like a human being with enough force to keep the human being from floating away. "Mass attraction" is another word for gravity, a force that exists between all matter.

== Units of mass ==
The unit of mass in the [[International System of Units]] is the [[kilogram]], which is represented by the symbol 'kg'. Fractions and multiples of this basic unit include the gram (one thousandth of a kg, symbol 'g') and the [[ton]]ne (one thousand kg), amongst many others.

In some fields or applications, it is convenient to use different units to simplify the discussions or writings. For instance,
* Atomic physicists deal with the tiny masses of individual [[atom]]s and measure them in [[atomic mass unit]]s.
* Jewelers normally work with small gems and precious stones where masses are traditionally measured in carats, which correspond to 200&nbsp;mg or 0.2 g.
* The masses of stars are very large and are sometimes expressed in units of [[Solar mass]]es.

Traditional units are still in encountered in some countries: [[Imperial unit]]s such as the [[ounce]] or the [[Pound (mass)|pound]] were in widespread use within the British Empire. Some of them are still popular in the United States, which also uses units like the short [[ton]] ton (2,000 pounds) and the long ton (2,240 pounds), not to be confused with the metric tonne (1,000&nbsp;kg).

== Conservation of mass and relativity ==
Mass is an intrinsic property of the object: it does not depend on its volume, or position in space, for instance. For a long time (at least since the works of [[Antoine Lavoisier]] in the second half of the eighteen century), it has been known that the sum of the masses of objects that interact or of the [[Chemical substance|chemicals]] that react remain conserved throughout these processes. This remains an excellent approximation for everyday life and even most laboratory work.

However, Einstein has shown through his [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]] that the mass ''m'' of an object moving at speed ''v'' with respect to an observer must be higher than the mass of the same object observed at rest ''m<sub>0</sub>'' with respect to the observer. The applicable formula is

<math>m=\\frac{m_0}{\\sqrt{1 - (v^2/c^2)}}</math>

where ''c'' stands for the [[speed of light]]. This change in mass is only important when the speed of the object with respect to the observer becomes a large fraction of ''c''.

Compared to what is known about the other planets in the [[Solar System]], little is known about Mercury. [[Telescope]]s on the Earth show only a small, bright crescent. The first of two [[spacecraft]] to visit the planet was [[Mariner 10|Mariner&nbsp;10]],<ref>[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1973-085A]</ref> which mapped only about 45% of the planet’s surface from 1974 to 1975. The second is the [[MESSENGER]] spacecraft, which finished mapping the planet in March 2013. 

Mercury looks a lot like Earth's [[Moon]]. It has many [[crater]]s with areas of smooth plains, no moons around it and no [[atmosphere]] as we know it. However, Mercury does have an extremely thin atmosphere, known as an exosphere.<ref name=sciencefact /> Unlike Earth's moon, Mercury has a large [[iron]] [[planetary core|core]], which gives off a [[magnetic field]] about 1% as strong as that of the [[Earth]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-spc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/papers/merc_mag/|title=Mercury magnetic field|publisher=C. T. Russell & J. G. Luhmann|accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref> It is a very dense planet due to the large size of its core. Surface temperatures can be anywhere from about 90 to {{nowrap|700 [[Kelvin|K]]}} (−183&nbsp;°C to 427&nbsp;°C, −297&nbsp;°F to 801&nbsp;°F),<ref name="ESAs&t">{{cite web|url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/category/index.cfm?fcategoryid=4586|title=Background Science|publisher=European Space Agency|accessdate=2008-05-23}}</ref> with the [[subsolar point]] being the hottest and the bottoms of craters near the [[Geographical pole|poles]] being the coldest.

Known sightings of Mercury date back to at least the first millennium BC. Before the 4th century BC, Greek [[astronomers]] thought that Mercury was two different objects: one able to be seen only at sunrise, which they called [[Apollo]]; the other that was only able to be seen at sunset, which they called [[Hermes]].<ref name="Dunne">{{cite book|title=The Voyage of Mariner&nbsp;10 — Mission to Venus and Mercury|author=Dunne, J.

Even though Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, it is not the warmest. This is because it has no [[greenhouse effect]], so any heat that the Sun gives to it quickly escapes into space.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/14143062 | title=CBBC Newsround | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate=February 04, 2012}}</ref>

== Inside Mercury ==
Mercury is one of four [[inner planet]]s in the [[Solar System]], and has a rocky body like the [[Earth]]. It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, with a [[radius]] of 2,439.7&nbsp;km.<ref name="nssdcMercury" /> Mercury is even smaller than some of the largest moons in the solar system, such as [[Ganymede]] and [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. However, it has a greater mass than the largest moons in the solar system. Mercury is made of about 70% [[metal]]lic and 30% [[silicate]] material.<ref name="strom" >{{cite book |title=Exploring Mercury: The Iron Planet |last=Strom |first=Strom, Robert G.|coauthors=Sprague, Ann L. |year=2003 |page=52 |isbn= 1852337311}}</ref> Mercury's density is the second highest in the Solar System at 5.427&nbsp;g/cm³, only a little bit less than Earth’s.<ref name="nssdcMercury" />

'''Mars''' is the fourth [[planet]] from the [[Sun]] in the [[Solar System]] and the second-smallest solid planet. Mars is [[rocky]] and [[cold]],<ref name=mep>{{cite web|url=http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/allaboutmars/extreme/|title=Mars: Extreme Planet|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2011-10-25}}</ref> with polar ice caps of [[wikt:frozen|frozen]] [[water]] and [[carbon dioxide]].<ref name=nasa070315/> It has the largest [[volcano]] in the [[Solar System]], and some very large [[impact craters]].<ref name=mep /> Mars is named after the [[mythology|mythological]] [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[Deity|god]] of [[war]] because it is a red planet, the [[colour]] of [[blood]].

== Appearance ==
[[File:Mars rocks.jpg|thumb|right|Surface with rocks everywhere photographed by [[Mars Pathfinder]]]]

Mars has two small [[Satellite (natural)|moons]], called [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]. The planet Mars is made of [[mineral|rock]]. The ground there is [[red]] because of [[iron oxide]] (rust) in the rocks and [[dust]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080106181124/http://erc.arc.nasa.gov/MarsVolc/basalt.htm|title=NASA Mars Page|work=Volcanology of Mars (Retrieved via the [[Internet Archive]])|accessdate=2009-05-13}}</ref> The planet's [[atmosphere]] is very thin and contains a lot of [[carbon dioxide]] and a very tiny amount of [[oxygen]]. The [[temperature]]s on Mars are colder than on Earth, because it is farther away from the Sun and has less air to keep warmth in.

The average [[wikt:thick|thickness]] of the planet's crust is about 50&nbsp;km (31&nbsp;mi), with a maximum thickness of 125&nbsp;km (78&nbsp;mi).<ref>{{cite news |author = Dave Jacqué |url = http://www.anl.gov/Media_Center/News/2003/030926mars.htm |title = APS X-rays reveal secrets of Mars' core | publisher = Argonne National Laboratory | date = 2003-09-26 | accessdate = 2006-07-01 | language = English }}</ref>

== Physical geography ==
=== Rotation ===
A Martian day is called a ''sol'', and is a little longer than an Earth day.  Mars rotates in 24 hours, and 37 minutes. It rotates on a [[wikt:tilt|tilt]], just like the Earth does, so it has four different [[season]]s. Of all the planets in the Solar System, the seasons of Mars are the most Earth-like, due to the similar tilts of the two planets' rotational axes. The lengths of the Martian seasons are about twice those of Earth's, as Mars's greater distance from the Sun leads to the Martian year being about two Earth years long. Martian surface temperatures vary from lows of about {{convert|−143 |°C|°F}} (at the winter polar caps)<ref name=cold>[http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/q2681.html What is the typical temperature on Mars?] Astronomycafe.net.

[[Landforms]] seen on Mars strongly suggest that liquid water at some time existed on the planet's surface. Huge areas of ground have been scraped and eroded.  These are known as 'outflow channels', and cut across the surface in about 25 places.

==== Polar caps ====

Mars has two permanent polar ice caps. During a pole's winter, it lies in continuous darkness, chilling the surface and causing the [[Deposition (geology)|deposition]] of 25–30% of the atmosphere into slabs of [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] ice ([[dry ice]]). When the poles are again exposed to sunlight, the frozen CO<sub>2</sub> [[Sublimation|sublimes]] (turns to vapor), creating enormous winds that sweep off the poles as fast as 400&nbsp;km/h. Each season this moves large amounts of dust and water vapor, giving rise to Earth-like frost and large [[cirrus cloud]]s and dust storms. Clouds of water-ice were photographed by the ''[[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]]'' rover in 2004.

The polar caps at both poles consist primarily of water ice.<ref name=nasa070315/>

=== Atmosphere ===
Mars has a very thin atmosphere with barely any oxygen (it is mostly [[carbon dioxide]]). Because there is an [[atmosphere]], however thin it is, the sky does change colour when the sun rises and sets. The dust in the Martian atmosphere make the Martian sunsets have a rather [[blue]] colour. Mars's atmosphere, of course, is too thin to protect Mars from [[meteor]]s, which is why the lower half of Mars has so many craters. 

=== Meteorite craters ===
After the formation of the planets, all experienced the "[[Late Heavy Bombardment]]". About 60% of the surface of Mars shows a record of impacts from that era.<ref name=barlow88>Barlow N.G. 1988. Conditions on early Mars: constraints from the cratering record. MEVTV Workshop on ''Early tectonic and volcanic evolution of Mars''. LPI Technical Report 89-04 (Easton, Maryland: Lunar and Planetary Institute) p15.</ref> Much of the remaining surface is probably lying over the immense impact basins caused by those events. There is evidence of an enormous impact basin in the northern hemisphere of Mars, spanning {{convert|10600|by|8500|km|mi|abbr=on}}, or roughly four times larger than the largest impact basin yet discovered.<ref> Sample, Ian 28 June 2008.

The event is thought to be the cause of the difference between the Martian hemispheres. It made the smooth [[Borealis basin]] that covers 40% of the planet.<ref name=sciam>Minkel J.R. June 2008.

Some meteorites hit Mars with so much force a few pieces of Mars went flying into space {{ndash}} even to Earth! Rocks on Earth are sometimes found which have chemicals that are exactly like the ones in Martian rocks. These rocks also look like they fell really quickly through the atmosphere, so it is [[wikt:reasonable|reasonable]] to think they came from Mars.

=== Geography ===
Mars is home to the highest known mountain in the Solar System, [[Olympus Mons]]. Olympus Mons is about 17 miles (or 27 kilometers) high. This is more than three times the height of Earth's tallest mountain, [[Mount Everest]]. It is also home to [[Valles Marineris]], the third largest [[Rift (geology)|rift]] system (canyon) in the Solar System, 4,000 km long.

Detailed observations of the location of Mars were made by [[Babylonian|Babylonian astronomers]] who developed methods using math to predict the future position of the planet. The ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek philosophers]] and astronomers developed a model of the solar system with the Earth at the center ('geocentric'), instead of the sun. They used this model to explain the planet's motions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Geocentric model|url=http://www.universetoday.com/32607/geocentric-model/|publisher=UniverseToday|accessdate=14 September 2013}}</ref>  [[India]]n and [[Islamic]] astronomers estimated the size of Mars and its distance from Earth.<ref name=swerdlow98>{{cite book | first=Noel M. | last=Swerdlow | year=1998 | pages=34–72 | title=The Babylonian theory of the planets | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn=0-691-01196-6 | chapter-url=Periodicity and Variability of Synodic Phenomenon | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0Df8Ma-zpgIC&pg=PA34 }}</ref><ref name=valery_cumont12>{{cite book | last1=Valery | first1=Franz | last2=Cumont | first2=Marie | title=Astrology and religion among the Greeks and Romans | work=American lectures on the history of religions | publisher=Putnam | page=46 | year=1912 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=82wKgaD_3dEC&pg=PA46 }}</ref> Similar work was done by [[Chinese people|Chinese]] astronomers.<ref name=evans98>{{cite book | first=James | last=Evans | year=1998 | title=The history & practice of ancient astronomy | page=297 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-509539-1 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Qg0_uiaWhT8C&pg=PA297 }}</ref>
 
In the 16th century, [[Nicholas Copernicus]] proposed a model for the [[Solar System]] in which the planets follow circular orbits about the [[Sun]]. This 'heliocentric' model was the beginning of modern astronomy. It was revised by [[Johannes Kepler]], who gave an [[Ellipse|elliptical orbit]] for Mars which better fit the data from our observations.<ref name=gingerich_maclachlan05>{{cite book | last1=Gingerich | first1=Owen | last2=MacLachlan | first2=James H. | year=2005 | title=Nicolaus Copernicus: making the Earth a planet | pages=57–61 | work=Oxford portraits in science | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-516173-4 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9k-pHc8l-TgC&pg=PA57 }}</ref><ref name=seop>{{cite journal | title=Nicolaus Copernicus | date=2005 | editor1-last=Zalta | editor1-first=Edward N. | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/copernicus/ | accessdate=2010-01-09 }}</ref><ref name=sat57>{{cite journal | last=Breyer | first=Stephen | year=1979 | title=Mutual occultation of planets | journal=Sky and Telescope | volume=57 | issue=3 | page=220 |bibcode = 1979S&T....57..220A }}</ref><ref name=longair03>{{cite book | first=M.S. | last=Longair | year=2003 | edition=2nd | title=Theoretical concepts in physics: an alternative view of theoretical reasoning in physics | pages=25–28 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=0-521-52878-X | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bA9Lp2GH6OEC&pg=PA25 }}</ref>

The first observations of Mars by [[telescope]] was by [[Galileo Galilei]] in 1610. Within a century, astronomers discovered distinct [[albedo]] features (changes in brightness) on the planet, including the dark patch and polar [[ice cap]]s. They were able to find the planet's day ([[rotation period]]) and [[axial tilt]].<ref name=jbaa94>{{cite journal | last=Moore | first=P. | year=1984 | title=The mapping of Mars | journal=Journal of the British Astronomical Association | volume=94 | issue=2 | pages=45–54 | bibcode=1984JBAA...94...45M }}</ref><ref name=sheehan_ch2>{{cite web | first=William | last=Sheehan | year=1996 | title=Chapter 2: pioneers | work=The planet Mars: a history of observation and discovery | publisher=University of Arizona | url=http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/onlinebks/mars/chap02.htm | accessdate=2010-01-16 }}</ref>

Better telescopes developed early in the 19th century allowed permanent Martian [[albedo]] features to be mapped in detail. The first crude map of Mars was published in 1840, followed by better maps from 1877 onward. Astronomers mistakenly thought they had detected the [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] mark of water in the Martian atmosphere, and the idea of life on Mars became [[wikt:popularise|popular]] among the public. [[Percival Lowell]] believed he could see an artificial network of [[canal]]s on Mars. These linear features later proved to be an [[optical illusion]], and the atmosphere was found to be too thin to support an Earth-like [[environment]], including surface water.

Yellow clouds on Mars have been observed since the 1870s, which were windblown sand or dust. During the 1920s, the range of Martian surface temperature was measured; it ranged from {{ndash}}85 to 7 <sup>o</sup>C. The planetary atmosphere was found to be arid with only traces of oxygen and water. In 1947, [[Gerard Kuiper]] showed that the thin Martian atmosphere contained extensive [[carbon dioxide]]; roughly double the quantity found in Earth's atmosphere. The first standard naming of Mars surface features was set in 1960 by the [[International Astronomical Union]]. 

Since the 1960s, multiple robotic [[spacecraft]] and [[rover (space exploration)|rovers]] have been sent to explore Mars from orbit and the surface. The planet has remained under observation by ground and space-based instruments across a broad range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] (visible light, infrared and others). The discovery of [[meteorite]]s on Earth that came from Mars has allowed laboratory examination of the chemical conditions on the planet.

=== Martian 'canals' ===

During the 1877 opposition, Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] used a {{convert|22|cm|abbr=on}} telescope to help produce the first detailed map of Mars. What caught people's attention was that the maps had features he called ''canali''.  These were later shown to be an [[optical illusion]] (not real). These ''canali'' were supposedly long straight lines on the surface of Mars to which he gave names of famous rivers on Earth. His term ''canali'' was popularly mistranslated in English as ''[[canals]]'', and thought to be made by intelligent beings.<ref name=milone_wilson08>{{cite book | last1=Milone | first1=Eugene F. | last2=Wilson | first2=William J.F. | title=Background science and the inner Solar System | page=228 | volume=1 | series=Solar System Astrophysics | publisher=Springer | year=2008 | isbn=0-387-73154-7 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CX040NargCEC&pg=PA228 }}</ref><ref name=sagan80>{{cite book | last=Sagan | first=Carl | title=Cosmos | publisher=Random House | year=1980 | page=107 | isbn=0-394-50294-9 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1gR8lSPrPq4C&pg=PA107 }}</ref>

== Life on Mars? ==
[[File:Mars Valles Marineris EDIT.jpg|250 px|default|right|Mars by Viking 1 in 1980]]

Because Mars is the one of the closest planets to [[Earth]] in the [[Solar System]], many have wondered if there is any kind of [[life]] on Mars. Today we know that the kind of life, if any, would be some simple [[bacteria]]-type organism. 

=== Meteorites ===
[[NASA]] maintains a catalog of 34 Mars [[meteorite]]s, that is, meteorites which originally came from Mars.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/snc/index.html|title=Mars Meteorites|accessdate=February 16, 2010|publisher=NASA}}</ref> These assets are highly valuable since they are the only physical samples available of Mars. 

Studies at NASA's [[Johnson Space Center]] show that at least three of the meteorites contain possible evidence of past life on Mars, in the form of microscopic structures resembling fossilized bacteria (so-called [[Organism|biomorphs]]). Although the scientific evidence collected is reliable, and the rocks are correctly described, what made the rocks look like they do is not clear. To date, scientists are still trying to agree if it really is evidence of simple life on Mars.<ref name="meteoritos-Bio">[http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/mgs/sci/fifthconf99/6142.pdf Evidence for ancient Martian life]. Gibson E. K. Jr. ''et al'' Mail Code SN2, NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston TX 77058, USA.</ref>

Over the past few decades, scientists have agreed that when using meteorites from other planets found on Earth (or rocks brought back to Earth), various things are needed to be sure of life. Those things include:<ref name="meteoritos-Bio"/>

#Did the rock comes from the right time and place on the planet for life to exist?	
#Does the sample contain evidence of [[bacterial]] [[cells]] (does it show fossils of some kind, even if very tiny)?
#Is there any evidence of biominerals? ([[minerals]] usually caused by living things)
#Is there any evidence of [[isotope]]s typical of life?
#Are the features part of the meteorite, and not contamination from Earth? 

For people to agree on past life in a geologic sample, most or all of these things must be met. This has not happened yet, but investigations are still in progress.<ref name="meteoritos-Bio"/> Reexaminations of the biomorphs found in the three Martian meteorites are underway.<ref>http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1001/09marslife/</ref>

=== The significance of water ===
Liquid water is necessary for life and [[metabolism]], so if water was present on Mars, the chances of life evolving is improved. The Viking orbiters found evidence of possible river valleys in many areas, erosion and, in the southern hemisphere, branched streams.<ref>Strom R.G., Steven K. Croft, and Nadine G. Barlow 1992. ''The Martian impact cratering record''.University of Arizona Press. ISBN 0-8165-1257-4</ref><ref>Raeburn P. 1998. Uncovering the secrets of the red planet Mars. National Geographic Society. Washington D.C.</ref><ref>Moore P. ''et a'' 1990. ''The Atlas of the Solar System''. Mitchell Beazley Publishers NY.</ref> Since then, rovers and orbiters have also looked closely and eventually proved water was on the surface at one time, and is still found as ice in the polar ice caps and underground.

=== Today ===
So far, scientists have not found life on Mars, either living or [[extinct]]. Several [[space probe]]s have gone to Mars to study it. Some have [[orbit]]ed (gone around) the planet, and some have landed on it. There are pictures of the surface of Mars that were sent back to Earth by the probes. Some people are interested in sending [[astronaut]]s to visit Mars. They could do a better search, but getting astronauts there would be difficult and expensive. The astronauts would be in space for many years, and it could be very dangerous because of [[radiation]] from the sun.  So far we have only sent unmanned probes.  

The most recent probe to the planet is the [[Mars Science Laboratory]].

The '''Macintosh Operating System''' ('''Mac OS''') is a program that allows a [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] [[computer]] to  operate and be used. Mac OS was first made by Apple Inc. in 1984. In those days Mac OS was called '''Macintosh System Software''' – which was shortened to '''System''' or '''SSW''' ('''S'''ystem '''S'''oft'''w'''are). The term "Mac OS" first appeared in the [[splash screen]] for System 7.5.1, but was not adopted as the new name until the release of [[Mac OS 7.6]].

The latest version of Mac OS is [[Mac OS X]] 10.11. The X in the OS X name is a roman numeral for 10.

The '''Apple Macintosh''' or just “Mac” is a line of [[personal computer]]s made by the American company [[Apple Inc.|Apple Inc]]. The Macintosh was one of the first computers in which the people could use a mouse for pointing on a screen which had icons. This new way of working with a computer ([[interface]]) was known as [[graphical user interfaces and consoles|graphical user interface]]. It was this feature of the Macintosh that made it so popular.

== History ==
=== Processor history ===
''See [[Apple Intel transition]].''

Macintoshes were different than other personal computers for many years based on their [[central processor unit]] (CPU). At the start, Macs used [[Motorola 68000]] chips instead of [[Intel]] chips. Later, Macs used [[PowerPC]] chips. In 2006, Macs started to use Intel chips. Today, Macs are sold with Intel quad-core [[Intel Core i7|i7]] chips.

=== Software ===
The Mac does not have the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system installed on it. It has its own range of operating systems, known as [[OS X]]. The newest operating system is known as “Yosemite". Macs can run both Windows and OS X at the same time with help of a program called “Boot Camp”, which comes on every Mac.

=== General opinion ===
In general, Macintosh computers cost more than other computers of the same size. But people say they have very good quality, which explains why they’re really expensive.

A '''metre''' (US spelling, ''meter'') is the basic [[units of measurement|unit]] of [[length]] in the [[SI]] measurement system. The [[abbreviation]] for the metre is '''m'''. The first meaning (in the [[French Revolution]]), it was 1/10,000,000th (one ten-millionth) of the [[distance]] between the [[Earth]]'s [[equator]] and the [[North Pole]] along the [[Paris]] [[meridian]].<ref name = NIST>{{cite web|url = http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/meter.html|title = Historical context of the SI|publisher = US Government - National Institute of Standards and Technology}}</ref> The metre is now officially defined as the distance light travels in a [[vacuum]] in 1/299,792,458 of a [[second]].<ref name = NIST/>

In the [[Imperial unit|imperial]] system of measurement, one metre is equal to about 39.37 [[inch]]es, 3.28 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]], or about 1.09 [[US yard|yards]].

A '''magnifying glass''' is a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] through which can be used to make things appear bigger, so you can see them better. It is used in many applications and manual operations, e.g., for examining [[postage stamps]] in [[philately]].

The magnifying glass consists of a piece of convex<ref>[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/convex convex in English Wiktionary].</ref>-shaped glass or plastic. It has to be held at the right distance between the eye and the object for the object to be in [[Focus (optics)|focus]]. The magnifying glass usually comes with a handle. A [[telescope]] is a more advanced kind of magnifying glass and consists of at least two glass lenses. 

A pair of [[binoculars]] is like a telescope for each eye. ''Spectacles'' or [[eyeglasses]] also use lenses to correct a person's vision.

[[Category:Philately]][[File:Glucose.PNG|200px|thumb|right|This is a [[sugar]] molecule. Carbon atoms are made blue, oxygen atoms are made red and hydrogen atoms are made white to show the difference. In reality atoms do not have a color.]]
A '''molecule''' is the smallest amount of a [[chemical substance]] that can exist. If a molecule were split into smaller pieces, it would be a different substance. 

Molecules are made up of [[atom]]s that are stuck together in a particular shape or [[form]]. Not all combinations of atoms are usually possible; atoms like certain shapes, but not others. Also, they like certain arrangements of atoms. For example, [[oxygen]] atoms always have two bonds with other atoms, [[carbon]] atoms always have four bonds with other atoms, and [[nitrogen]] atoms always have three bonds with other atoms.

In [[gas]]es like [[air]], the molecules are just flying around. In [[liquid]]s like [[water]], the molecules are stuck together but they can still move. In [[solid]]s like [[sugar]], the molecules can only [[vibrate]]. There is also another state of matter known as plasma where the molecules fly around crazier and faster than those in a gas. 
With a [[molecular formula]], you can write down the numbers of all atoms in a molecule. For example, the molecular formula of [[glucose]] is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. That means that one molecule of glucose is made up of six carbon atoms, twelve hydrogen atoms and six oxygen atoms.

== Bonding ==

For a molecule to exist, [[atoms]] have to stick together. This happens when two atoms share [[electron]]s. Instead of circling just one atom, the electron now circles around two. This is called bonding. The shared electrons are called 'bonds'. Sometimes, more than one electron is shared. The more electrons are shared, the stronger the bond gets and the stronger the atoms stick together.

Bonds can also be broken apart. Since most bonds require energy to form, they also give off energy when they are broken. But before most bonds break, the molecule has to be heated. Then the atoms start to move, and when they move too much, the bond breaks. Molecules that require less energy to break than they give off when broken are called fuels. For example, a candle will just sit there and nothing happens. But when you use a match to light it, it will burn for a long time. The match brings the energy to break the first bonds, which release enough energy to break the bonds below them, until the candle has burned down.

A larger, 'collective', mosque is called a ''masjid jāmi''.<ref>{{lang-ar| مساجد جامع}}, ''masjid jāmi‘''.</ref> Larger mosques offer more [[service]]s to their [[community]]. 

For many Muslim people, a mosque is more than a place of worship. Muslims worship, study and discuss [[Islam]], and do many other things in a mosque and its compounds. In the [[United Kingdom]], many mosques are used as community centres. They are also used to teach about Islam. Religious [[festival]]s and gatherings are held in mosques. Weddings are one example. Mosques have rules to control what people do inside. One of these rules is that it is considered rude to disturb another person who is worshipping. 

Many mosques are known for their [[Islamic architecture]]. The earliest mosques, opened in [[7th century]] were open-air spaces. They are the ''[[Quba Mosque]]'' and ''[[Masjid al-Nabawi]]''.  Later Mosques were buildings that were specially designed. Nowadays, mosques are in every [[continent]], except [[Antarctica]].

The mosque played a major part in the spread of education in the Muslim World, and the association of the mosque with education remained one of its main characteristics throughout history<ref>{{Cite book|Islam = A.L. Tibawi: Islamic Education, Luzac and Company Ltd, London, 1972, p. 24}}</ref>, and, the school became an indispensable appendage to the mosque<ref>{{Cite book|Islam = S. P. Scott, History, op. cit., p.467.}}</ref>. From the earliest days of Islam, the mosque was the centre of the Muslim community, a place for prayer, meditation, religious instruction, political discussion, and a school. And anywhere Islam took hold, mosques were established, and basic religious and educational instruction began. Once established, mosques developed into well-known places of learning, often with hundreds, even thousands, of students, and frequently contained important libraries<ref>{{Cite book|Mosque Role = J. Waardenburg: "Some Institutional Aspects of Muslim Higher Learning", NVMEN, 12/2 (April 1965): 96-138; p. 98.}}</ref>

== Architecture ==
[[File:Jami-Ul-Alfar.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The ''Jami Ul Alfar'' mosque in [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]], has striking Moorish and Colonial architecture with a candy-striped [[facade]].]]
Many mosques are famous works of [[architecture]]. They are often built in a style that has stayed the same for many centuries. Many mosques have prayer halls, [[dome]]s, and [[minaret]]s. They may also have a [[courtyard]]. 

Mosques were first built on the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The Muslims who built them used old architectural styles. They also combined these styles in new ways. A major influence was the [[palace]]s built during the [[Parthia]]n and [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] [[dynasty|dynasties]] of [[Persia]]. The ''[[Sarvestan palace]]'' from the Sassanid era is a good example of this. It has an [[arch]]ed entrance and a central dome. These features already existed in [[Persia]] before Islam.

After the Arab invasion of Persia, the new style, with its Sassanid influence, was used for the new [[Muslim|Islamic world]]. Many forms of mosques have developed in different regions of the Islamic world. Important mosque types include the early [[Abbasid Empire|Abbasid]] mosques, T-type mosques, and the central-dome mosques of [[Anatolia]]. In the [[20th century]], many countries that grew rich from [[Petroleum|oil]] paid for the building of many new mosques. The rulers of these countries often hired leading architects to design these mosques. They included non-Muslims.

=== Arab plan ===
[[File:Cairo al-Azhar 7.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Al Azhar|Al Azhar Mosque]] in Cairo, Egypt has a hypostyle hall]] 
Many early mosques have a square or [[rectangle|rectangular]] plan. They also have a prayer hall and an enclosed courtyard. This is known as ''Arab-plan''. The first mosques of this type were built during the [[Umayyad Dynasty]].  

The flat [[roof]] of the prayer hall was supported by [[column]]s. Many rows of columns were needed to support such roofs;<ref name="Masdjid1" /> this is called "[[Hypostyle|hypostyle architecture]]". One of the most famous hypostyle mosques is the [[Mezquita de Córdoba]] in [[Spain]]. It is supported by over 850 columns.<ref name = "mit-handout"/> 

In the warm [[Mediterranean]] and Middle Eastern [[climate]]s, the courtyard served to hold the large number of worshippers during Friday prayers. Often, hypostyle mosques have outer [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]]. They allow the visitors to enjoy the [[shade]]. Arab-plan mosques were built mostly during the Umayyad and [[Abbasid]] dynasties. The Arab plan was very simple, which did not allow for much further development. This caused that style of mosque to fall out of favour.<ref name="Masdjid1">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hillenbrand| first = R | editor = P.J. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E.

In the central Islamic lands | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | id = {{ISSN|1573-3912}} }}</ref>

=== Central dome ===
The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] began building ''central dome mosques'' in the [[15th century|fifteenth century]]. These mosques have a large dome centered over the prayer hall. There may also be smaller domes, which are off-center over the prayer hall or the rest of the mosque.<ref name="mit-vocab">{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Architecture/4-614Religious-Architecture-and-Islamic-CulturesFall2002/LectureNotes/detail/vocab-islam.htm#islam6 |accessdate=2006-04-09 |title=Vocabulary of Islamic Architecture |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology}}</ref> This style was heavily influenced by the [[Byzantine]] [[religious architecture]] with its use of central domes.<ref name="Masdjid1" />

=== Iwan ===
''Iwan mosques'' are famous for their domed rooms and ''[[iwan]]s''. Iwans are spaces with an arched roof. They have an opening at one end. One or more iwans face a central courtyard that serves as the prayer hall. The style borrows from pre-Islamic Iranian architecture. Most mosques with this style are in [[Iran]].

== Parts of Mosques ==
=== Minarets ===
{{main|Minaret}}

[[File:AleppoGreatMosque.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Great Mosque in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]]. The tower-like structure is the minaret.]]
Most mosques have minarets. Minarets are tall [[tower]]s. Usually they are at one of the corners of the mosque. The top of the minaret is the highest point in the mosque, and usually the highest point in the area around the mosque. The tallest minaret in the world is in the [[Hassan II Mosque]] in [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Call to Prayer: My Travels in Spain, Portugal and Morocco |last=Walters |first=Brian |date=[[May 17]], [[2004]] |publisher=Virtualbookworm Publishing |isbn=1-58939-592-1 |pages=14 |chapter=The Prophet's People |quote=Its 210-meter minaret is the tallest in the world}}</ref>

The first mosques had no minarets. The most [[conservatism|conservative]] Islamic groups, like ''[[Wahhabism|Wahhabis]]'', still avoid building minarets. They see them as simply a fancy decoration and unnecessary. The first minaret was built in 665 in [[Basra]] during the [[reign]] of the [[Umayyad]] [[caliph]] [[Muawiyah I]]. Muawiyah encouraged the building of minarets, as they were supposed to be the same as [[bell tower]]s on [[Christian]] [[church]]es. Because of this, mosque architects used the shape of the bell tower for their minarets. Both the minaret and the bell tower serve the same purpose — to call the faithful to prayer.<ref name="Manara">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hillenbrand| first = R | editor = P.J. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E. Bosworth]], E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs | encyclopedia =[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online| title = Manara, Manar | publisher = Brill Academic Publishers | id = ISSN 1573-3912}}</ref>

Before the five required daily prayers, a ''[[muezzin]]'' calls the worshippers to [[salat|prayer]] from the minaret. In many countries like Singapore where Muslims are not the majority, mosques are stopped from loudly playing the call to prayer. The main problem is the use of [[electronics|electronic]] amplification of the call, which is now widely used by mosques.

=== Domes ===
[[File:Khatem Al Anbiyaa Mosque Detail.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The domes of the Khatem Al Anbiyaa Mosque in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]]]

The [[dome]]s were often placed directly above the main prayer hall. They represent the universe that Allah created.<ref>{{cite book|title=Symmetries of Nature: A Handbook for Philosophy of Nature and Science |last=Mainzer |first=Klaus |date=[[June 1]], [[1996]]|isbn=3-11-012990-6 |pages=124 |chapter=Art and Architecture |quote=the dome arching over the believers like the spherical dome of the sky}}</ref> At first, these domes were small. They only took up a small part of the roof near the ''[[mihrab]]''. Later, they took the whole roof above the prayer hall. 
Domes normally have the shape of a [[hemisphere]]. The [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in [[India]] popularized [[onion]]-shaped domes in [[South Asia]] and [[Persia]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Architecture of Mughal India |last=Asher |first=Catherine B. |date= 1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=256 |isbn=0-521-26728-5 |chapter=Aurangzeb and the Islamization of the Mughal style}}</ref> Some mosques have several domes, as well as the main large dome. The other domes are often smaller.

Domes would help the ''imam'' be heard, as the sound waves would bounce in and then out of the dome making the voice louder.

=== Prayer hall ===
All mosques have a [[prayer]] hall, which is also called ''[[musalla]]''. Normally, there is no [[furniture]] in it except for prayer [[wikt:mat|mats]] or [[rug]]s. These are necessary, as Islamic prayer is usually done [[knee]]ling. 

Some mosques have [[Arabic calligraphy]] and ''[[Qur'an]]ic'' verses on the walls to help worshipers focus on the beauty of Islam and its holiest book, the ''Qur'an'', as well as for decoration.<ref name="teach-islam">{{cite book|title=Teach Yourself Islam |last=Maqsood |first=Ruqaiyyah Waris |isbn=0-07-141963-2 |date=[[2003-04-22]] |edition=2nd edition |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=57–8, 72–5, 112–120 |location=Chicago}}</ref>

The ''[[qiblah]] wall'' is usually at the other side of the entrance to the prayer hall. This wall is specially decorated. In a properly sited mosque, it will be set [[wikt:perpendicular|perpendicular]] to a line leading to [[Mecca]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Writing Signs: Fatimid Public Text |date=[[1998-12-16]] |last=Bierman |first=Irene A. |publisher=University of California Press |pages=150 |isbn=0-520-20802-1}}</ref> People pray in rows parallel to the ''qiblah'' wall. They arrange themselves so they face [[Mecca]]. In the ''qiblah'' wall, usually at its center, is the ''[[mihrab]]'', a niche or depression showing the direction of [[Mecca]]. The ''mihrab'' serves as the place where the [[imam]] leads the five daily prayers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~islamarc/WebPage1/htm_eng/index/keyword1_e.htm |accessdate=2006-04-09 |title=Terms 1: Mosque |publisher=University of Tokyo Institute of Oriental Culture}}</ref>

=== Washing ===
All people must wash themselves before they pray. Mosques often have [[fountain]]s or other facilities for washing in their entrances or courtyards, so that people can perform the washing [[ritual]] before prayer.
At very small mosques, worshippers may use restrooms for their ritual washing, or wu'du. In traditional mosques, there is often a building specially for washing. This is often in the center of the courtyard.<ref name="mit-handout">{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/4.614/www/handout02.html |accessdate=2006-04-09 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |title=Religious Architecture and Islamic Cultures}}</ref> In the prayer halls, people must not wear shoes for much the same reason.<ref name="Abudhabitourism">{{cite web|url=http://www.abudhabitourism.ae/en/info/sheikh.zayed.mosque.aspx|title=Dress and Behaviour Code for the Sheikh Zayed Mosque|publisher=Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority}}</ref><ref name="islamqa">{{cite web|url=http://www.islamqa.com/en/ref/69793|title=Praying in shoes in a mosque where there are carpets}}</ref>

=== Modern features ===
Modern mosques should appeal to the community they serve. For this reason, other facilities may also be available at the mosque, like [[clinic|health clinics]], [[library|libraries]], and [[gym|sports halls.]]

=== The inside of mosques ===

== Religious functions ==
=== Prayers ===
[[File:Mosque.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Muslims performing [[salat]] at the [[Umayyad Mosque]]]]

Adult Muslims are expected to pray five times a day. Most mosques have formal prayers for each of these times. If performing the prayer is difficult, for example for [[ill]] people, then exceptions are made.  

Mosques also hold a special prayer service, called ''[[jumuah]]''. This is done once a week. It is a form of [[Sabbath]] and replaces the Friday prayers at the mosque. Daily prayers can be done anywhere. However, Muslims are expected to do their Friday prayer at the mosque.<ref name="teach-islam">{{cite book|title=Teach Yourself Islam |last=Maqsood |first=Ruqaiyyah Waris |isbn=0-07-141963-2 |date=[[April 22]], [[2003]] |edition=2nd edition |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=57–8, 72–5, 112–120 |location=Chicago}}</ref>

When a Muslim dies, a funeral prayer is normally held. It is held outdoors in a courtyard or square close to the mosque. The prayers have all the worshippers present, including the imam, taking part.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/law/fiqhussunnah/fus4_62.html |title=Fiqh-us-Sunnah, Volume 4: Funeral Prayers (Salatul Janazah)|publisher=University of Southern California |work=Compendium of Muslim Texts |accessdate=2006-04-16}}</ref> During [[eclipse]]s, mosques will host special prayers called [[Sunnah salat#Qusuf and Khusuf|eclipse prayers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/018.sbt.html |title=Eclipses |publisher=University of Southern California |work=Compendium of Muslim Texts |accessdate=2006-04-16}}</ref>

There are two large holidays (''Eids'') in the [[Islamic calendar]]. During these days, there are special prayers at mosques in the morning. Larger mosques will normally hold them for their own communities as well as the people from smaller local mosques. Mosques, especially those in countries where Muslims are the majority, will also host ''Eid'' prayers outside in courtyards or [[town square]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/prayer/Eid-Prayers_1.html |accessdate=2006-04-08 |title='Id Prayers (Salatul 'Idain) |publisher=University of Southern California |work=Compendium of Muslim Texts}}</ref>

=== Ramadan events ===
{{see also|Ramadan}}
There are many events in ''[[Ramadan]]'', Islam's holiest month. During ''Ramadan'', Muslims must [[fasting|fast]] during the day. Mosques organise ''[[iftar]]'' dinners after sunset. These are done after the fourth required prayer of the day. Part of the food is given by members of the community, which creates nightly [[potluck]] dinners. The community contribution to these dinners is required. For this reason, mosques with smaller communities may not be able to hold the ''iftar'' dinners daily. 

Some mosques will also hold meals in the morning before [[dawn]]. Mosques will often invite poorer members of the community to these meals. Islam sees giving [[charity (practice)|charity]] during Ramadan as good acts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/pillars/fasting/tajuddin/fast_51.html| accessdate=2006-04-17| title=Charity| publisher=University of Southern California |work=Compendium of Muslim Texts}}</ref>

Larger mosques sometimes offer special, optional prayers. They are done after the last required prayer of the day. During each night of prayers, one member of the community who has memorized the entire [[Qur’an]] will recite a part of the book. It can last for up to two hours.<ref name="teach-islam" /> Sometimes, several such people (not necessarily of the local community) take turns to do this. During the last ten days of Ramadan, larger mosques will host all-night programs to observe ''[[Laylat al-Qadr]]''. It is the night Muslims believe that the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] first received Qur'anic revelations.<ref name="teach-islam" /> On that night, between [[sunset]] and [[sunrise]], mosques employ speakers to teach the worshipers about Islam. Mosques or the community usually provide meals at times through the night.
[[File:AlAbbasMosque01.jpg|thumb|right|right|200px|The [[Al Abbas Mosque|Al-‘Abbās Mosque]] in [[Karbala]], [[Iraq]] is visited by millions of [[Shia]] pilgrims each year.]]

== Political functions ==
[[File:Mesquita de Cuiabá.jpg|thumb|right|right|200px|Mosque in [[Cuiabá]], [[Brazil]]]]
During the late twentieth century, more and more mosques have been used for [[political]] purposes. Modern-day mosques in the Western world want to educate good citizens. The details differ greatly from mosque to mosque and from country to country.

=== Advocacy ===
Countries with small Muslim populations use mosques as a way to support civic participation. They are more likely to do this than Muslim-majority countries of the [[Greater Middle East]].<ref name="tc">{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.edu/muslim-nyc/research/projects/role%20of%20muslims.html |publisher=Teachers' College – Columbia University |title=The Role of Mosques in the civic and political incorporation of Muslim America |last=Jamal |first=Amany |accessdate=2006-04-22}}</ref> American mosques host [[voter registration]] and civic participation drives. In the United States, Muslims are often [[migration|immigrants]], or the children of immigrants. Mosques want to interest these people for politics. They also want to keep them informed about issues that concern the Muslim community. People who attend the services at the mosque regularly are more likely to take part in [[protest]]s, to sign [[petition]]s, and to involve themselves in political matters.<ref name="tc" />

A link between [[Ideology|political views]] and mosque attendance can still be seen in other parts of the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Study: Islam devotion not linked to terror|url=http://www.umich.edu/~urecord/0405/Jun13_05/03.shtml|publisher=The University Record Online |last=Swanbrow |first=Diane |date=2005-06-23 |accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref> After the [[al-Askari Mosque bombing (2006)|al-Askari Mosque bombing]] in February 2006, imams and other Islamic leaders used mosques and [[jumuah|Friday prayers]] to call for calm and peace during the widespread [[violence]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4747886.stm |date=2006-02-24 |accessdate=2006-04-23 |title=Friday prayer plea for Iraq calm |publisher=BBC}}</ref>

Beginning in the late twentieth century and continuing into the early twenty-first century, a small number of mosques have also become a base for extremist imams to support [[terrorism]] and [[Islamic fundamentalism|extreme Islamic ideals]]. [[Finsbury Park Mosque]] in [[London]] is a mosque that has been used in this manner.

=== Social conflict ===

{{see also|Babri Masjid|Islamophobia|Israeli-Palestinian conflict}}

Like other places of worship, mosques can be at the center of social [[conflict]]s. 

[[Babri Mosque]] was the centre of such a conflict up until the early 1990s when it was [[wikt:demolish|demolished]]. Before a solution could be found, the mosque was destroyed by about 200,000 Hindus. It took place on 6 December 1992. The mosque was built by [[Babur]] to mark the birthplace of [[Rama|Ram]]. It was believed to be on a site of an earlier [[Hindu temple]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Flashpoint Ayodhya |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0407/abstracts/ayodhya.html |date=July/August 2004 |publisher=Archaeology |last=Romey |first=Kristen M.}}</ref> The conflict over the mosque was directly linked to [[Bombay Riots|rioting in Bombay]] (present-day [[Mumbai]]) as well as [[1993 Mumbai bombings|bombings in 1993]] that killed 257 people.

In February 2006, [[al-Askari Mosque bombing (2006)|a bombing]] seriously damaged Iraq's [[Al Askari Mosque|al-Askari Mosque]]. This increased the existing tensions. The conflict between two Muslim groups in Iraq had already led to other bombings. However mosque bombings are not limited to Iraq. In June 2005, a [[suicide attack|suicide bomber]] killed at least 19 people at an [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] mosque.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/01/AR2005060100263.html |date=2006-06-02 |accessdate=2006-04-23 |title=Suicide Bomber Kills 20 in Afghan Mosque |publisher=The Washington Post |page=A16 |last=Aizenman |first=N.C.}}</ref> In April 2006, there were [[2006 Jama Masjid explosions|two explosions]] at [[India]]'s [[Jama Masjid]].

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], several American mosques were targets of attacks. These ranged from simple [[vandalism]] to [[arson]].<ref>

=== Saudi influence ===
{{see also|Wahhabism}}
[[Saudia Arabia|Saudi]] involvement in building mosques around the world only goes back to the 1960s.<ref name="money-trails">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A13266-2004Aug18 |title=U.S. Eyes Money Trails of Saudi-Backed Charities |date=2004-08-19 |accessdate=2007-02-24|last=Ottoway |first=David B. |page=A1 |publisher=The Washington Post}}</ref>
In the 1980s, the Saudi Arabian government began to pay for the building of mosques in countries around the world. An estimated [[United States dollar|US$]]45 billion has been spent by the Saudi Arabian government for mosques and Islamic schools in foreign countries. ''[[Ain al-Yaqeen]]'', a Saudi newspaper, reported in 2002 that Saudi money may have helped to build as many as 1,500 mosques and 2,000 other Islamic centers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/031215/15terror.htm |title=The Saudi Connection |date=2003-12-15 |accessdate=2006-04-17 |last=Kaplan |first=David E. |publisher=U.S. News and World Report}}</ref> [[Saudi]] citizens have also given a lot of money to mosques in the Islamic world, especially in countries where they see Muslims as poor and oppressed.

== Rules and behaviour in mosques ==
[[File:Bayt al Mukarram.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Baitul Mukarram]] (Dhaka), the National Mosque of [[Bangladesh]] 

The structure resembles the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]].]]

In a mosque, people should keep focused on worshiping ''Allah''. For this reason, there are a number of rules about the correct behaviour in a mosque. Some of these rules are the same all over the world, such as no shoes should be worn in the prayer hall. Other rules are different from mosque to mosque.

=== Prayer leader ===
It is generally seen as good to have someone who leads the prayers, though this is not strictly necessary.<ref name="mawardi112">{{cite book | last=Abu al-Hasankok
Ibn Muhammad Ibn Habib |first=Al-Mawardi |author=Al-Mawardi | title=The Ordinances of Government (''Al-Ahkam al-Sultaniyya w’al-Wilayat al-Diniyya'') | publisher=Garnet Publishing | location=Lebanon | year=2000 | isbn=1-85964-140-7|pages=184}}</ref> The person who usually leads the prayers is called ''imam''. He must be a free and honest man. He should also be an authority when it comes to answering questions on religion.<ref name="mawardi112" /> In mosques that were built or that are kept up by the government, the imam is selected by the ruler.<ref name="mawardi112" /> In private mosques, the community selects the imam, through [[majority rule|majority voting]]. 

[[File:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|Interior of the [[Mezquita]], a [[hypostyle]] former mosque with columns arranged in grid pattern, in [[Córdoba, Spain]].]]
Only men may lead prayers for men.<ref name="mawardi112" />  Women are allowed to lead prayers for congregations where there are only women.

=== Attending a mosque ===
In addition to washing, there are other rules that also apply to those who enter the mosque, even if they do not wish to pray there. It is forbidden to wear shoes in the [[carpet]]ed area of the prayer hall. Some mosques also do not allow wearing shoes in other parts, even though these may not be devoted to praying. 

[[Islam]] requires that its believers wear [[Islam and clothing|clothes]] that show [[modesty]]. As a result, both men and women must follow this rule when they attend a mosque (though mosques may not always enforce the rules). Men are supposed to come to the mosque wearing loose and clean clothes that do not show the shape of the body. Similarly, women who come to the mosque are expected to wear loose clothing, shirts, pants that cover to the wrists and ankles and cover their heads such as with a ''[[hijab]]''. Many Muslims, regardless of their ethnic background, wear [[Middle East|Middle eastern]] clothing associated with [[Arab]]ic Islam to special occasions and prayers at mosques.<ref name="teach-islam" />

Mosques are places of worship. For this reason, those inside the mosque should be respectful to those who are praying. Loud talking or discussion of topics that could be disrespectful, is forbidden in areas where people are praying. It is also considered as rude to walk in front of Muslims in prayer or otherwise disturb  them.<ref>{{cite paper|author=Connecting Cultures, Inc. |title=Building Cultural Competency: understanding Islam, Muslims, and Arab culture |publisher=Connecting Cultures, Inc. |url=http://www.maec.org/2004conferencepapers/ismail.doc |page=p. 15 |format=Doc |accessdate=2006-07-12}}</ref> 

=== Men and women pray in different parts ===
[[File:Islam in India.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Muslims]] praying in the male section of a mosque in [[Srinagar]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]], India]]

[[Shari'a|Islamic law]] requires men and women to be separated in the prayer hall. Ideally, women should pray behind men. [[Muhammad]] said, women should pray at home, not at the mosque. Muhammad thought women should not be forbidden in mosques. The second [[caliph]] [[Umar I|Umar]] at one time stopped women from attending mosques, especially at night, because he feared they may be teased by males, so he made them to pray at home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/humanrelations/womeninislam/womeninsociety.html#mosque |accessdate=2006-04-15 |title=Women in Society |publisher=University of Southern California |work=Compendium of Muslim Texts |last=Doi |first=Abdur Rahman I.}}</ref> Sometimes a special part of the mosque was railed off for women; for example, the governor of Mecca in 870 had ropes tied between the columns to make a separate place for women.<ref name="Masdjid1" />

Many mosques today will put the women behind a barrier or partition or in another room. Mosques in [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] put men and women in separate rooms, as the divisions were built into them centuries ago. In nearly two-thirds of [[United States of America|American]] mosques, women pray behind partitions or in separate areas, not in the main prayer hall; some mosques do not admit women at all. Although there are sections only for women and children, the [[Masjid al-Haram|Grand Mosque]] in [[Mecca]] is desegregated.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.columbiajournalist.org/rw1_dinges/2005/article.asp?subj=national&course=rw1_dinges&id=624 |accessdate=2006-04-09 |date=2006-01-26 |title=Muslim women seek more equitable role in Mosques |last=Rezk |first=Rawya |publisher=The Columbia Journalist}}</ref>

=== Non-Muslims in mosques ===

A few scholars of [[sharia|Islamic law]] believe that non-Muslims may be allowed into mosques, as long as they do not sleep or eat there. Followers of the ''[[Maliki]]'' [[madhhab|school]] of [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] disagree. They say that non-Muslims may not be allowed into mosques at all.<ref name="mawardi112" />

Different countries have different opinions on the question. Nearly all the mosques in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] as well as [[Morocco]] do not allow non-Muslims. The [[Hassan II Mosque]] in [[Casablanca]] is one of only two mosques in Morocco currently open to non-Muslims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/02/25/morocco.travel.ap/index.html|title=Morocco travel|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2006-09-22}}</ref> 

In modern-day [[Saudi Arabia]], the Grand Mosque and all of [[Mecca]] are open only to Muslims. Likewise, the [[Masjid al-Nabawi]] and the city of [[Medina]] that surrounds it are also off-limits to those who do not practice Islam.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Beliefs & Religions|last=Goring |first=Rosemary |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |date=1997-05-01 |isbn=1-85326-354-0}}</ref> For mosques in other areas, it has most commonly been taken that non-Muslims may only enter mosques if granted permission to do so by Muslims and if they have a proper reason.<ref name="teach-islam" />

In modern [[Turkey]] non-Muslim [[tourist]]s are allowed to enter any mosque, but must obey the rules of [[decorum]]. Visiting a mosque is allowed only between prayers; visitors must wear long trousers and take off their shoes; women must cover their heads; no photos; no loud talk is allowed. No references to other religions are allowed (no crosses on necklaces, no cross gestures etc.).

However, there are also many other places in the west as well as the Islamic world where non-Muslims are welcome to enter mosques. Most mosques in the [[United States]], for example, report receiving non-Muslim visitors every month.<ref name="mosquesinamerica">{{Cite paper | coauthors=Bagby, Ihsan; Perl, Paul M.; and Froehle, Bryan T. | title=The Mosque in America: a national portrait | publisher=Council on American-Islamic Relations | year=2001 | url=http://www.cair-net.org/mosquereport/Masjid_Study_Project_2000_Report.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2006-04-17}}</ref> Many Mosques throughout the United States welcome non-Muslims as a sign of openness to the rest of the community and to encourage conversions to Islam.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Takim |first=Liyakatali |month=July |year=2004 |title=From Conversion to Conversation: Interfaith Dialogue in Post 9–11 America |journal=The Muslim World |volume=94 |pages=343–355 |url=http://macdonald.hartsem.edu/articles/mw943f.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2006-06-16 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.2004.00058.x}} Liyakatali Takim is a professor in the Department of Religious studies at the University of Denver</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4511780.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2006-06-16 |title=Laptop link-up: A day at the mosque |date=2005-12-05}}</ref>

=== Dogs ===
Dogs are usually banned from entering mosques, but on 24 September 2008, the Muslim Law Council UK made special ruling, called a ''[[fatwa]]'', which granted a blind Muslim permission to take his guide dog into the mosque.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/7633623.stm |title=BBC NEWS &#124; England &#124; Leicestershire &#124; Ruling allows guide dog in mosque |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date=24 September 2008|accessdate=2008-11-03}}</ref>

== Mosques as hostels ==
It is common for a smaller mosque to serve as a [[hostel]] for Muslims on ''[[haj]]'' ([[pilgrimage]] to Mecca). Sometimes mosques are used for [[refugee]]s, or as temporary homes for homeless people. [[Obligations to neighbours in Islam]] are very strict, and specific. In the [[Qur'an]] Mohammed said that a person who helps others in the hour of need, and who helps the oppressed; that person God will help on the Day of Travail (agony).<ref>

</ref> There are other commands, such as helping the poor and being nice to people. An important part of being Muslim, or just being part of the mosque, is taking care of people who need help. A mosque is a social, as well as a religious, group.

A [[madrassa]] is a little different from a mosque. A madrassa focuses on teaching Islam, usually to children and young people.

== Mosques in Spain ==
[[File:Spain Andalusia Cordoba BW 2015-10-27 13-54-14.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Mezquita de Córdoba]] was a mosque. Today, it is the cathedral of Cordoba.]]
When Spain was under Muslim control, some of the most beautiful buildings were mosques. After 1491, Spain was under Christian control. However, the Christians did not tear down the mosques. They simply put a [[crucifix]] in them to make them into churches. These mosques influenced the [[Renaissance]] [[architecture]] (way of building) in Europe.

'''Mammals''' are the group of [[vertebrate]] [[animal]]s which form the [[class (biology)|class]] '''Mammalia'''. They have [[fur]] and a very precise kind of [[homoiothermy|temperature regulation]]. The females bear live young, and produce milk for the young. Parental care of the young is universal among mammals, and it is essential because live birth limits the number of offspring.

== Main characteristics ==
=== Reproductive cycle ===
Most [[marsupial]] and [[eutherian]] mammals have a reproductive cycle known as the [[oestrous cycle]] (U.S: estrous cycle). Females are sexually active only during the oestrous stage, when they are 'on heat' for a few days each month. If an [[ovum]] is not fertilised, the [[endometrium]] ([[uterus]] lining) is resorbed. Oestrus cycles may occur once or twice a year, or many times a year. Each group of mammals has its own frequency.

Humans and [[primate]]s, are quite different. They have a [[menstrual cycle]]. In this case, females are sexually receptive at any time, but only fertile when an ovum is released from an ovary. In this case, the endometrium (if not needed for an fertilised egg) is discarded. The endometrium is shed, and takes with it a certain amount of blood. In this system, eggs are released from the ovaries mostly in the middle of the cycle, away from the menstrual period. This [[ovulation]] is 'concealed', meaning, it is not obvious when it occurs. This process, so it is thought, tends to keep the male and female together, which is unusual in mammals with the oestrous cycle.

=== Skeleton ===
One [[diagnosis|diagnostic]] feature is the lower [[jaw]] which, unlike earlier forms, is composed of a single bone, the [[dentary]]. This is one feature which can be seen in fossils, or at least those which are complete enough to have the lower jaw. Mammals have three little bones in their inner ear, the [[ear ossicles]]. The ear ossicles are bones which were, long ago, part of the lower jaw in early proto-mammals.

There are quite a number of other features, particularly in the skull and limbs, so that it is usually possible identify and describe a mammal from its skeleton alone.

=== Neocortex and behaviour ===
Another diagnostic feature is the [[Cerebral cortex#Neocortex|neocortex]] of the [[Vertebrate brain|brain]], which no other vertebrate has. This is involved in the kind of flexible [[behaviour]] and [[learning]] typical of mammals. Reptiles and birds have much of their behaviour controlled by "inherited behaviour chains", which roughly translates as "[[instinct]]s". Almost all animals can do some learning, but mammals do far more than other vertebrates. Their behaviour is much more flexible than [[lizards]], for example, and that is made possible by their neocortex.

Other things in the life of mammals seem to be connected with this flexibility  and learning. [[Play (activity)|Play]] is a kind of early learning period in which, according to one theory,<ref>Burghardt, Gordon M. 2006. ''The genesis of animal play: testing the limits''. MIT Press, p11. ISBN 0-262-02543-4</ref> mammals develop skills which they will need in life. All mammalian young play, and this is very obvious in the more intelligent mammals ([[primates]], [[cats]]).

The [[emotions]] of mammals are very noticeable, and rather similar to ours. It is possible, and quite common, for humans to have a friendly relationship with another mammal. It is quite impossible for a human to have any kind of relationship with a snake or a [[gecko]] (for example). This is because the reptile simply does not have the same basic emotions as a human.

=== Other items ===
There are about 50 characters which are typical of mammals, and some of the most important are discussed above. A few more examples will make it clear that mammals are very different from reptiles and birds:
*[[Sweat]] glands
*Tooth replacement: two sets, and no continuous replacement. Enamel on the tooth surface. Reptile teeth all alike; mammal [[teeth]] follow a pattern ([[incisor]]s, [[canine]]s, [[premolar]]s and [[molar]]s)
*Occipital condyles. Two knobs at the base of the skull fit into the topmost neck [[vertebra]]; most [[tetrapods]], in contrast, have only one such knob
*Outlet for foodwaste separate from [[urinogenital]] outlet. Reptiles and birds have a common [[cloaca]] at the rear
*Mammals [[excretion|excrete]] [[urea]]; reptiles and birds excrete [[uric acid]]
*[[Colour vision]] is defective or absent in most mammals (primates are an exception)
*In reptiles and birds the blood vessel which carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle of the heart lies on the right side of the body; but in mammals it lies on the left side.<ref>Kermack D.M. & K.A. 1984. ''The evolution of mammalian characters''. London: Croom Helm, p6. ISBN 0-7099-1534-9</ref>
*There are many features of the skeleton that mammals share 
**Their neck always has seven vertebrae, no matter how long it is.
**Their lower jaw is made of just a single bone on each side, the [[dentary]].
**Their [[inner ear]] has three tiny bones, the [[ossicles]]: malleus, incus and stapes.
In the language of [[cladistics]], these 50 unique characters are [[apomorphy|apomorphies]] which prove that mammals are a [[clade]] descended from a [[common ancestor]].<ref>Kemp T.S. 2005. ''The origin and evolution of mammals''. Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-850761-5</ref>

== Main groups ==
Almost all mammals give [[birth]] to live young. There are only two mammals that lay [[Cleidoic egg|eggs]], called [[monotreme]]s, the duck-billed [[platypus]] ''Ornithorhynchus'', and the spiny anteater ''[[Echidna]]'', with four species. All are confined to [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]], and are the sole survivors of an earlier group of mammals. However, like other mammals, they feed milk to their young, and protect and look after them.

Other mammals are divided into the [[marsupials]] and the [[Eutheria]], the [[placenta]]l mammals. Marsupials are mammals with pouches to carry young in, like the [[kangaroo]].

== Modes of life ==
In terms of number of species mammals, with 5488 species,<ref>{{cite web | title=Initiatives |  work=The IUCN Red List of threatened species | date=April 2010 | publisher=IUCN | url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/initiatives}}</ref> are not the most successful vertebrates.

reptiles have just as many as birds.<ref>[http://www.reptile-database.org/ The Reptile Database]</ref> Fish have even more species. There are 27,000 species of fish, of which nearly 26,000 are bony fish.<ref>Nelson, Joseph S. 2006. Fishes of the World. 4th ed, John Wiley. ISBN 9780471756446 [http://web.archive.org/web/20130305052159/http://www.somas.stonybrook.edu/~conover/Textbooks/Fishes%20of%20the%20World,%204th%20ed.%20Joseph%20S.%20Nelson.pdf]</ref>

Despite this, many zoologists do regard mammals as a successful group of animals. One reason is that they are successful in all [[habitats]] on Earth. In the air, in the water, in [[forests]], in the colder regions of the world, and above all on [[grasslands]], where they are outstandingly successful.

In the air, the [[bats]] ([[Chiroptera]]) are the mammalian order with the most species. They 'own' the nighttime, since birds are largely diurnal (daytime) animals. Bats are hugely successful, mostly as nighttime predators of insects.

Seagoing mammals, the [[Cetacea]] and the [[pinniped]]s, are very successful and significant [[predator]]s. This includes the [[whale]]s, [[Pinniped|seals]], [[walrus]], [[dolphin]]s and others.

The terrestrial mammals are fewer in number of species than [[lizards]], but they are huge in individual numbers, and far more important in the life of the terrestrial [[biome]]s. Their ability to move from place to place and adapt has made them a most effective group. Many mammals live in cold places. These mammals have thick hair or [[blubber]] to keep them warm. Others may live in rainforests. On land the [[rodent]]s (rats, mice) are hugely successful, more common in numbers than any other mammals. Large mammals on land have been hunted to [[extinct]]ion in some parts of the world, but the ones which remain are now better protected.

Last, but certainly not least, are the [[primate]]s. Their natural [[habitat]], with few exceptions, are the [[forest]]s. Most live in the trees, with hands that grasp, good [[colour vision]], and [[intelligence]]. In the [[Pliocene]] period some moved out onto the [[savannah]]s as [[grassland]] replaced forests. [[Mankind]] is the result of this shift into the savannahs.

== Taxonomy ==
The evolutionary relationships among land vertebrates is as follows:
*[[Tetrapoda]] (land vertebrates)
**[[Amphibia]] (lay eggs in water)
**[[Amniota]] (lay [[cleidoic egg]]s)
***[[Sauropsida]] (all true '[[reptile]]s')
***[[Synapsida]] (all '[[mammal-like reptile|mammal-like amniotes]]')
****[[Pelycosauria]]
****[[Therapsida]]
*****'''Mammalia''' (bear live young; milk; raise their young etc.)

This sort of classification is not traditional, but it does reflect our knowledge of [[palaeontology]] and [[evolution]].<ref>Clack Jennifer A. 2012. ''Gaining Ground: the origin and early evolution of tetrapods''. 2nd ed, Indiana University Press, Bloomington IN. ISBN 978-0-253-35675-8</ref>

[[File:Sdk intro.gif|thumb|right|A [[Sudoku]] puzzle]]

A '''number''' is a [[concept]] from [[mathematics]], used to [[counting|count]] or [[measurement|measure]]. Depending on the field of mathematics, where numbers are used, there are different definitions:
* People use [[symbol]]s to represent numbers; they call them [[numeral]]s. Common places where numerals are used are for labeling, as in [[telephone number]]s, for ordering, as in [[serial number]]s, or to put a unique identifier, as in an [[ISBN]], a unique number that can identify a [[book]].
* [[Cardinal number]]s are used to measure how many items are in a [[set]]. {A,B,C} has size "3".
* [[Ordinal number]]s are used to specify a certain element in a [[set]] or [[sequence]] (''first'', ''second'', ''third'').

Numbers are also used for other things besides counting. Numbers are used when things are [[measure]]d. Numbers are used to study how the world works. [[Mathematics]] is a way to use numbers to learn about the world and make things. The study of the rules of the natural world is called [[science]]. The work that uses numbers to make things is called [[engineering]].

== Numbering methods ==
=== Numbers for people ===
There are different ways of giving symbols to numbers. These methods are called number systems. The most common number system that people use is the ''base ten'' number system. The ''base ten'' number system is also called the ''decimal'' number system. The base ten number system is common because people have ten [[finger]]s and ten [[toe]]s. There are 10 different symbols {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9} used in the base ten number system. These ten symbols are called digits.<ref>A finger or a toe is also called a digit.</ref>

A symbol for a number is made up of these ten digits. The position of the digits shows how big the number is. For example, the number 23 in the decimal number system really means (2 times 10) plus 3, and 101 means 1 times a hundred (=100) plus 0 times 10 (=0) plus 1 times 1 (=1).

=== Numbers for [[machine]]s ===
Another number system is more common for machines. The machine number system is called the ''[[binary]]'' number system. The binary number system is also called the base two number system. There are two different symbols (0 and 1) used in the base two number system. These two symbols are called bits.<ref>A bit is a short form of the words "binary digit".</ref>

A symbol for a binary number is made up of these two bit symbols. The position of the bit symbols shows how big the number is. For example, the number 10 in the binary number system really means 1 times 2 plus 0, and 101 means 1 times four (=4) plus 0 times two (=0) plus 1 times 1 (=1). The binary number 10 is the same as the decimal number 2. The binary number 101 is the same as the decimal number 5.

== Names of numbers ==
{{seealso|Names of numbers in English}}
English has special names for some of the numbers in the decimal number system that are "[[Exponentiation|powers]] of ten". All of these power of ten numbers in the decimal number system use just the symbol "1" and the symbol "0". For example, ten tens is the same as ten times ten, or one hundred. In symbols, this is "10 × 10 = 100". Also, ten hundreds is the same as ten times one hundred, or one thousand. In symbols, this is "10 × 100 = 10 × 10 × 10 = 1000". Some other power of ten numbers also have special names:

* [[1 (number)|1]] – one
* [[10 (number)|10]] – ten
* 100 – one [[hundred]]
* 1000 – one [[thousand]]
* [[1,000,000]] – one [[million]]

When dealing with larger numbers than this, there are two different ways of naming the numbers in English. Under the "long scale" a new name is given every time the number is a million times larger than the last named number. It is also called the "British Standard". This scale used to be common in Britain but is not often used in English-speaking countries today. It is still used in some other European nations. Another scale is the "short scale" under which a new name is given every time a number is a thousand times larger than the last named number. This scale is a lot more common in most English-speaking nations today.

* 1,000,000,000 – one [[billion]] (short scale), one [[milliard]] (long scale)
* 1,000,000,000,000 – one [[trillion]] (short scale), one [[billion]] (long scale)
* 1,000,000,000,000,000 – one [[quadrillion]] (short scale), one [[names for large numbers|billiard]] (long scale)

== Types of numbers ==
=== Natural numbers ===
'''[[Natural number]]s''' are the numbers which we normally use for counting, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 etc. Some people say that 0 is a natural number, too.

Another name for these numbers is [[positive numbers]]. These numbers are sometimes written as +1 to show that they are different from the negative numbers. But not all positive numbers are natural (for example <math>\\frac{1}{2}</math> is positive, but not natural).

If 0 is called a natural number, then the natural numbers are the same as the whole numbers. If 0 is not called a natural number, then the natural numbers are the same as the counting numbers. So if the words "natural numbers" are not used, then there will be less confusion about whether zero is included or not. But unfortunately, some say that zero is not a whole number, either, and some say whole numbers can be negative. "Positive integers" and "non-negative integers" are another way to include zero or exclude zero, but only if people know those words.

=== Negative numbers ===
'''[[Negative number]]s''' are numbers less than zero.

One way to think of negative numbers is using a ''number line''. We call one point on this line zero. Then we will label (write the name of) every position on the line by how far to the right of the zero point it is, for example the point one is one centimeter to the right, the point two is two centimeters to the right.

Now think about a point which is one centimeter to the left of the zero point. We cannot call this point one, as there is already a point called one. We therefore call this point minus 1 (−1) (as it is one centimeter away, but in the opposite direction).

A drawing of a number line is below.

[[File:NumberLineIntegers.svg|Number line -6 to 6]]

All the normal operations of mathematics can be done with negative numbers:

If people add a negative number to another this is the same as taking away the positive number with the same numerals. For example, 5 + (−3) is the same as 5 − 3, and equals 2.

If they take away a negative number from another this is the same as adding the positive number with the same numerals. For example, 5 − (−3) is the same as 5 + 3, and equals 8.

If they [[multiplication|multiply]] two negative numbers together they get a positive number. For example, −5 times −3 is 15.

If they multiply a negative number by a positive number, or multiply a positive number by a negative number, they get a negative result. For example, 5 times −3 is −15.

As finding the square root of a negative number is impossible as negative times negative equals possitve. We simbolise the square root of a negative number as i.

=== Integers ===
'''[[Integer]]s''' are all the natural numbers, all their [[opposite number|opposites]], and the number [[zero]]. [[Decimal|Decimal numbers]] and fractions are not integers.

=== Rational numbers ===
'''[[Rational number]]s''' are numbers which can be written as [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]. This means that they can be written as ''a'' divided by ''b'', where the numbers ''a'' and ''b'' are integers, and ''b'' is not equal to 0.

Some rational numbers, such as 1/10, need a [[finite]] number of digits after the [[decimal point]] to write them in [[decimal]] form. The number one tenth is written in decimal form as 0.1. Numbers written with a finite decimal form are rational. Some rational numbers, such as 1/11, need an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of digits after the decimal point to write them in decimal form. There is a repeating pattern to the digits following the decimal point. The number one eleventh is written in decimal form as [[0.0909090909 ]]... .

A [[percentage]] could be called a rational number, because a percentage like 7% can be written as the fraction 7/100. It can also be written as the decimal 0.07. Sometimes, a [[ratio]] is considered as a rational number.

=== Irrational numbers ===
'''[[Irrational numbers]]''' are numbers which cannot be written as a fraction, but do not have [[imaginary numbers|imaginary]] parts (explained later).
[[File:Square root of 2 triangle.png|thumb|right | √2 is irrational.]]
Irrational numbers often occur in [[geometry]]. For instance if we have a square which has sides of 1 meter, the distance between opposite corners is the [[square root]] of two, which equals 1.414213 ... . This is an irrational number. Mathematicians have [[mathematical proof|proved]] that the [[square root]] of every natural number is either an integer or an irrational number.

One well-known irrational number is [[Pi (mathematical constant)|pi]]. This is the [[circumference]] (distance around) of a circle divided by its [[diameter]] (distance across). This number is the same for every circle. The number pi is approximately 3.1415926535 ... .

An irrational number cannot be fully written down in [[decimal]] form. It would have an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of digits after the decimal point. Unlike 0.333333 ..., these digits would not repeat forever.

=== Real numbers ===
'''[[Real number]]s''' is a name for all the sets of numbers listed above:
* The rational numbers, including integers
* The irrational numbers
This is all numbers that do not involve [[Number#Imaginary numbers|imaginary numbers]].

=== Imaginary numbers ===
'''[[Imaginary number]]s''' are formed by real numbers multiplied by the number '''i'''. This number is the [[square root]] of minus one (−1).

There is no number in the real numbers which when [[squared]] makes the number −1. Therefore, mathematicians invented a number. They called this number '''i''', or the '''imaginary unit'''.

Imaginary numbers operate under the same rules as real numbers:
* The sum of two imaginary numbers is found by pulling out (factoring out) the '''i'''. For example, 2'''i''' + 3'''i''' = (2 + 3)'''i''' = 5'''i'''.
* The difference of two imaginary numbers is found similarly.  For example, 5'''i''' − 3'''i''' = (5 − 3)'''i''' = 2'''i'''.
* When multiplying two imaginary numbers, remember that '''i''' × '''i''' (i<sup>2</sup>) is −1.  For example, 5'''i''' × 3'''i''' = ( 5 × 3 ) × ( '''i''' × '''i''' ) = 15 × (−1) = −15.

Imaginary numbers were called ''imaginary'' because when they were first found, many mathematicians did not think they existed.{{Fact|date=April 2009}} The person who ''discovered'' imaginary numbers was [[Gerolamo Cardano]] in the 1500s. The first to use the words ''imaginary number'' was [[René Descartes]]. The first people to use these numbers were [[Leonard Euler]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]. Both lived in the [[18th century]].

=== Complex numbers ===
'''[[Complex number]]s''' are numbers which have two parts; a ''real'' part and an ''imaginary'' part. Every type of number written above is also a complex number.

Complex numbers are a more general form of numbers. The complex numbers can be drawn on a number plane. This is composed of a real number line, and an imaginary number line.

              |
              |
           −3i|_
              |

All of normal mathematics can be done with complex numbers:
* To add two complex numbers, add the real and imaginary parts separately. For example, (2 + 3'''i''') + (3 + 2'''i''')  = (2 + 3) + (3 + 2)'''i'''= 5 + 5'''i'''.
* To subtract one complex number from another, subtract the real and imaginary parts separately.  For example, (7 + 5'''i''') − (3 + 3'''i''') = (7 − 3) + (5 − 3)'''i''' = 4 + 2'''i'''.

To multiply two complex numbers is complicated. It is easiest to describe in general terms, with two complex numbers a + b'''i''' and c + d'''i'''.

<math>( a + b \\mathrm{i} ) \\times ( c + d\\mathrm{i} ) = a \\times c + a \\times d\\mathrm{i} + b\\mathrm{i} \\times c + b\\mathrm{i} \\times d\\mathrm{i} = ac + ad\\mathrm{i} + bc\\mathrm{i} -bd = ( ac - bd ) + ( ad + bc )\\mathrm{i}</math>

For example, (4 + 5'''i''') × (3 + 2'''i''') = (4 × 3 − 5 × 2) + (4 × 2 + 5 × 3)'''i''' = (12 − 10) + (8 + 15)'''i''' = 2 + 23'''i'''.

=== Transcendental numbers ===
A real or complex number is called a ''[[transcendental number]]'' if it can '''not''' be obtained as a result of an algebraic equation with integer coefficients.

<math> a_{n}x^{n} + \\dots + a_{2}x^2 + a_{1}x + a_{0} = 0 </math>

Proving that a certain number is transcendental can be extremely difficult. Each transcendental number is also an irrational number. The first people to see that there were transcendental numbers were [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and [[Leonhard Euler]]. The first to actually prove there were transcendental numbers was [[Joseph Liouville]]. He did this in [[1844]].

Well-known transcendental numbers:
* [[E (mathematical constant)|e]]
* [[Pi (mathematical constant)|π]]
* e<sup>a</sup> for algebraic a <tt>≠</tt> 0
* <math>2^{\\sqrt{2}}</math>

'''November''' is the eleventh and penultimate (second-last) [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], coming between [[October]] and [[December]]. It has 30 [[day]]s. Its name is from the [[Latin]] word ''novem'', which meant "nine". It was the ninth month of the year before [[January]] and [[February]] were added to the [[Julian Calendar|Roman Calendar]]. November begins on the same day of the week as [[March]] every year and also [[February]] except in [[leap year]]s.

November's [[flower]] is the [[Chrysanthemum]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[topaz]]. The meaning of the topaz is  {{broken wikt link|Fidelity|fidelity}}.

== The Month ==
[[File:SonnenuntergangSchweiz.JPG|thumb|180px|right|Early November [[sun]]set in [[Switzerland]], where it is an [[Autumn]] month.]]
November is the eleventh [[month]] of the year in the [[Gregorian calendar]], after [[October]] and before [[December]], which is the last month. November has 30 days. It was the ninth month in the old [[Roman calendar]], which is where its name comes from. It kept its name when [[January]] and [[February]] were added to the beginning of the year, despite becoming the [[eleven]]th [[month]]. The ninth month is now [[September]].

November begins on the same day of the week as [[March]] every year, and also begins on the same day as [[February]] in [[common year]]s. It always ends on the same day of the week as [[August]], as [[August 31]] and [[November 30]] are exactly 13 [[week]]s (91 [[day]]s) apart.

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], November is an [[Autumn]] (Fall) [[month]], and the further north in the hemisphere, the more likely it is to get colder as [[December]] approaches. In the [[Southern Hemisphere]] it is a [[Spring]] month. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the [[season]]al equivalent of [[May]] in the other.

Several observances around the beginning of the month are believed to be related, linked to the old [[Celts|Celtic]] celebration of [[Samhain]] on [[November 1]]. These events include [[Halloween]] ([[October 31]]), [[Day of the Dead]] in [[Mexico]] ([[October 31]] to [[November 2]]), [[All Saints Day]] ([[November 1]]) and All Souls Day ([[November 2]]).

In several mainly Christian countries, it is month in which people who died in [[war]] are commonly remembered, mainly related to the end of [[World War I]] on [[November 11]], [[1918]]. Near the end of the month [[Advent]], the period leading up to [[Christmas]], begins.

The [[Astrology|astrological]] signs for November are [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]] ([[October 24]] to [[November 22]]) and [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] ([[November 23]] to [[December 21]]). The birth flower is the [[chrysanthemum]] and the birth stone is the [[topaz]].

{{Months}}A '''national anthem''' is a [[song]] that the people of a country use to remember and respect their [[country]].

Some countries, like [[Spain]], have a national anthem which has no [[lyrics]] (words of a song)

* [[List of national anthems]]


{{music-stub}}

[[Category:National anthems| ]]'''Name''' is a [[word]] (or a set of words) given to things and [[people]]. 

For example, ''cat'' is the name of a kind of animal. "Ryan" is a name of a person, usually a male.  "Julia" is a common female name. 

The word 'name' can also be used as a [[verb]]. To name something is to give it a name.

==People's names==
In many [[culture]]s, there are rules and customs about how to give a person a name. 

Some of the rules are defined by [[law]]s, and others are defined by traditions (doing things in the way they have been done for a long time). 

There are rules about different aspects of the names and naming, including the following:

'''1. Number of parts of a name'''

In some cultures, a person has a one-part name, such as "ShiningWater." 

In other cultures, a person has a two-part name, such as "John Smith."

In some cultures, a person can have any number of name parts. In the [[United States]], for example, some people have three: first name, middle name, and last name. Other people have only two: a first and last name.

In Chinese cultures, it is typical for a person to have three-part name, such as "Cheah Ching San," where "Cheah" is the surname. Written in English format a comma is introduced making it "Ching San, Cheah."

'''2. Relations with names of parents and other relatives'''

In some cultures, people have the same "[[family name]]" (or surname) as their parents. For example, the father of John Smith may be Mike Smith. And Mike Smith's father may be James Smith. The "Smith" part is the same for all the family. 

In other cultures, a person has the same name as his or her father, but the name is in a different place. For example, Shafiq Hanif's son may be Hanif Kamal. Hanif is in both the father's and son's name. 

'''3. Name changes'''

In some cultures, a name changes when people marry, divorce, go through some religious ceremony, [[etc]]. For example, in some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, people use two last names: their mother's father's name and their father's name. If Elena Rodriguez Gomez and Jose Sanchez Soria marry, she may change her name to Elena Rodriguez de Sanchez, and their child could be named Pilar Sanchez Rodriguez, taking the names of both of her grandfathers. 

'''4. Name origins'''

In some cultures, personal names come from history. In most [[Europe]]an countries, some first names are taken from the [[Bible]]. In some cultures, names are taken from a relative. In other cultures, a name shows what the parents hope their child will be like. A baby may be given a name Wisdom because parents hope the baby will be a wise girl or boy. 

Some cultures avoid giving people a name of an animal. For example, there is no name like dog, cat, snake, owl, or fish in Japanese people's first names. But in some cultures animal names may be good. 

'''5. Lengths, pronunciations, spelling, etc.'''

In some languages and cultures, you can tell if a word is a person's name or not by just looking at the spelling or listening to its pronunciation. There are some other linguistic patterns. For example, many Chinese names are made up of three syllables. 

'''6. Use of names, titles, nicknames, etc.'''

In some cultures, people use names when they call each other. In other cultures, people use their nicknames. In some other cultures, people use their titles ("father," "professor," etc.) when they call each other.

'''7. Spelling of names, titles, nicknames, etc.'''

'''8. Name awareness

Taking note of names is taken a step farther by those who elect to celebrate a name (e.g., "Celebrate Your Name Week") whether their own name, someone else's name, or names in general, complete ownership of one's name might very well include celebrating it. 

'''9. Middle names

While some people might choose to "hide" a middle name for any number of reasons (i.e., they consider the middle name they were given to be an "embarrassment"), others have taken to celebrating their middle name (e.g., "Middle Name Pride Day").

In the English language, names exclusively are usually pronounced in correlation with the spelling, however can be pronounced as desired, e.g. John is (jon) but can also be (ned). However not probable, is held true in the English rules of grammar.

'''Examples of names'''

Sarah, Lucy, Ellen, Claire, Ben.

Names can be shortened e.g. Isabelle can become Izzy or Belle.

==Japanese names==
Here are some things that are often found in [[Japan]]ese names today. In the past, people went by different rules.  

'''1. Number of parts of a name'''

Japanese names have two parts. One is the family name and the other is the given name. 

"[[Ichiro Suzuki|Suzuki Ichiro]]" is a name of a Japanese person. Suzuki is the family name, and Ichiro is the first name. In the Japanese language, the family name comes first, and the given name comes second. (It is like writing Smith John, instead of John Smith.)

Only some members of the royal family do not have a family name. 

'''2. Relations with names of parents and other relatives'''

A newborn baby gets a family name from their parents. The parents have the same family name. So, a son of Ono Yoko (female) and Ono Ken (male) is Ono something. 

The family name Ono is mostly shared by the paternal (male) part of the family. So Ono Ken's parents have the family name Ono, but Ono Yoko's parents probably do not. 

'''3. Name changes'''

Names of people change when they marry and divorce. It is a custom in many parts of the world that women change their family name to that of their new husband when they marry. However, in Europe and North America especially, many women no longer do this even though their mothers and grandmothers may have. Sometimes, the man will take the woman's family name. 

'''4. Name origins'''

'''5. Lengths, pronunciations, spelling, etc. '''

'''6. Use of names, titles, nicknames, etc. '''

[[Category:Names| ]]'''Niihau''' (or '''Niʻihau''') is the smallest of the [[inhabited]] [[island]]s of [[Hawaii]], in the [[United States]]. It has a land area of 70 sq. miles (184 km<sup>2</sup>). It is the oldest of the eight main [[Hawaiian Islands|islands]].

The whole island is owned by the [[Robinson]] family. They bought it from the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] for $10,000. It was said that the buyer, [[Elizabeth Sinclair]] (later Sinclair-Robinson), liked the island better than other places such as [[Waikiki]], [[Pearl Harbor]], and the island of [[Lanai]]. There is a small [[United States Navy|US Navy]] [[Military base|base]] where a [[handful]] of Navy people work.

The island has a few hundred [[wikt:permanent|permanent]] [[inhabitant]]s. Almost all of them are [[Indigenous peoples|native]] [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiians]]. They [[support]] themselves largely with small family farms. Many work for the [[ranch]] owned by the Robinsons. The native Hawaiians lead a [[rural]], [[low-tech]] life. They speak the Hawaiian language and keep [[tradition]]s alive. This is because Ms. Sinclair promised to help [[preserve]] [[Hawaiian culture]] and tradition when she bought the island. Niihau is the only one of the Hawaiian islands where the [[Hawaiian language]] is the main language.

Niihau is also known as the "Forbidden Island". This is due to the fact that until recently, the island was off-limits to all but family members, US Navy personnel, [[government]] [[official]]s and expressly invited [[wikt:guest|guest]]s. Now, [[tourist]]s can go on one of a limited number of [[supervise]]d [[tour]]s or [[hunting]] [[safaris]].

On the beaches of the island are found [[Animal shell|shells]] which are the only shells to be classified as [[gems]]. Niihau shells and the [[jewelry]] made from them are very popular. Many, especially those with darker and richer color, are [[collector]]s items. The [[sale]] of shells and shell jewelry brings extra [[money]] for the local people.

This is an unmistakable species, with its generally brown plumage (feathers) and darker head. Its strong toes have much reduced webbing (skin between the toes), an adjustment to the [[lava]] flows on which it breeds.<ref name=fifty/> The Nēnē goes about on land much more than other water birds. When moulting (dropping old feathers and growing new ones), the Nēnē cannot fly, as do other geese, a factor which made it vulnerable to hunting.

The Nēnē was once among the most [[wikt:threaten|threatened]] [[waterfowl]] [[species]] around the world.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ducks.org/hunting/waterfowl-id/hawaiian-nene-goose |title=Hawaiian 'Nene' Goose Facts, Figures, Description and Photo |work=ducks.org |accessdate=7 April 2011}}</ref> Once common, hunting and [[predator]]s brought to the islands such as [[mongoose]]s, [[pig]]s and [[cat]]s reduced the population to only 30 birds in the 1950s.<ref name=bbc/> However, this species breeds well in captivity (zoos and bird parks), and has been successfully re-introduced. There are also good numbers in wild bird collections.

The Nēnē is the state bird of [[Hawaii]].<ref name=fifty>{{Cite web

[[Category:Tools]]'''Internet slang''' is [[slang]] words which are used on the [[internet]]. Most of these words are new, such as [[Wiki]] and [[blog]], which were not used before the internet became [[Popularity|popular]].

Some old words were given new [[meaning]]s, such as [[mail]] (which now means [[email]]). There are many [[mixed metaphor]]s on the Internet, such as [[boot]] (which used to mean a [[shoe]]) and [[link]] (which used to mean a join in a metal [[wikt:simple:chain|chain]]). Some existing [[acronym]]s, such as "AFK" (To mean "Away from keyboard") and "IRL" (To mean "In real life") were used on [[bulletin board system]]s before the internet became popular. These are now used on the internet, such as in [[chat room]]s and on [[instant messaging|instant messenger]] software.

People have also created some [[verb]]s and [[adjective]]s to describe things that only happen on the internet:

* To [[flame]] - to send [[wikt:offensive|offensive]] messages, usually in chat rooms, [[Internet forum|forums]], instant messaging software or email.
* To [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]] - to send some [[information|data]] to another [[computer]] and see how long it takes for the data to come back.

== Shorthand words ==
[[Shorthand]] is where a word is written in a [[short]]er way because it is quicker and easier to type. It is also done to fit more [[wikt:simple:text|text]] into a limited space.

== Acronyms ==
Internet slang uses many [[acronym]]s because they are quicker and easier to type. They are often [[shorthand]] for common [[phrase]]s and [[idiom]]s, but they can show somebody's emotions and their [[wikt:certainty|certainty]].

== Leet speak ==
Leet speak (written as: L33T or 1337) is the most common [[language]] on [[MMORPG]]s because rude words are not stopped by [[filter]]s. This language is changing all the time because new words are made and used. A lot of the words use [[number]]s instead of letters but some were made because of typing errors which are now done on purpose. Also, some [[suffix]]es are used, such as ''-age'' and ''-ness''.

Some of the numbers and symbols used instead of letters are in the table below.

'''Nauru''' is a small [[island]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It's 42 kilometers south of the equator and has a surface area of 23.3km². This one island is one country (a [[republic]]). It sells [[phosphate]] (a chemical) to [[Australia]]. Nauru is the smallest republic in the world. [[English language|English]] and [[Nauruan language|Nauruan]] are the official languages of Nauru. Nauru has no official [[Capital (city)|capital]], but its biggest city is [[Yaren]]. The current president of Nauru is [[Baron Waqa]]. There are 14 [[district]]s in Nauru:

}}
A '''noun''' is a kind of [[word]] (see [[part of speech]]) that is usually the [[name]] of something such as a [[person]], [[place]], [[thing]], [[quality]], or [[idea]]. In [[English language|English]], nouns can be [[singular]] or [[plural]].

Nouns often need a word called an [[article (grammar)|article]] or [[determiner]] (like ''the'' or ''that''). These words usually do not go with other kinds of words like [[verb]]s or [[adverb]]s. (For example, people do not also describe nouns. In English, there are more nouns than any other kind of word.

Every language in the world has nouns, but they are not always used in the same ways. They also can have different properties in different languages. For example, in some other languages, nouns do not change for singular and plural, and sometimes there is no word for ''the''.

Some examples of nouns in English are: ''time, people, way, year, government, day, world, life, work, part, number, house, system, company, end, party, information''.

== The history of the word ''noun'' ==
The word 'noun' comes from the [[Latin]] ''nomen'' meaning "[[name]]." Words like nouns were described in early days by the [[Sanskrit]] grammarian [[Panini (grammarian)|Pāṇini]] and ancient Greeks like [[Dionysios Thrax]].

== Uses of nouns ==
In English [[sentence]]s, nouns can be used as a [[subject]], [[object (grammar)|object]], or [[complement]]. They often come after [[preposition]]s, as the 'object of preposition'.

Nouns can sometimes describe other nouns (such as a '''soccer''' ball). When they do this, they are called [[modifier]]s or adjuncts.

There are also [[verb]] forms that can be used in the same way as nouns (such as 'I like ''running''.)  These are called ''verbals'' or ''verbal nouns'', and include ''[[participle]]s'' (which can also be adjectives) and ''[[infinitive]]s''.

== Kinds of nouns and how they are ordered ==
Nouns are ordered into '''common nouns''', and '''proper nouns'''. There are also [[pronoun]]s. These have commonly been considered a different part of speech from nouns, but in the past some grammars have included them as nouns<ref>"noun, a.1" ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. <http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/display/00327657?keytype=ref&ijkey=56n3orQ0BYHJo>.</ref> as do many modern [[Linguistics|linguists]].<ref>Huddleston, R. & Pullum, G. K. (2002). ''The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language''. Cambridge: Cambridge UP.</ref>

=== Proper nouns ===
A '''proper noun''' (also called '''proper name''') is a name given to individual people, places, companies, or brands. Some examples of proper nouns are: ''London, John, God, October, Mozart, Saturday, Coke, Mr. Brown, Atlantic Ocean''

Proper nouns begin with an [[upper case]] ([[Majuscule|capital]]) letter in [[English language|English]] and many other languages that use the [[Roman alphabet]].  (However, in [[German language|German]], all nouns begin with an upper case letter.) The word "I" is really a pronoun, although it is capitalized in English, like a proper noun.

Some common nouns (see below) can also be used as proper nouns. For example, someone might be named 'Tiger Smith' -- even though he is not a [[tiger]] or a [[smith]].

=== Common nouns ===
'''Common nouns''' are all other nouns that are not proper nouns. Sometimes the same word can be either a common noun or a proper noun, depending on how it is used; for example:
* there can be many ''[[gods]]'', but there is only one ''[[God]]''.
* there can be many ''internets'' (two or more networks connected together), but the largest internet in the world is the ''[[Internet]]''.

== Number and countability ==
In English and many other languages, nouns have 'number'. But some nouns are only [[singular]] (such as ''furniture, physics'') and others are only [[plural]] (such as ''clothes, police''). Also, some nouns are 'countable' (they can be counted, for example, ''one piece, two pieces'') but others are not (for example, we do not say ''one furniture, two furnitures'').

== Possessives ==
Nouns are words for things, and since things can be possessed, nouns can also change to show possession in grammar. In English, we usually add an [[apostrophe]] and an ''s'' to nouns to make them ''possessive'', or sometimes just an apostrophe when there is already an ''s'' at the end, like this:
* This is Sam. This is '''Sam's''' cat.
* The '''woman's''' hair is long.
* There are three cats. The '''cats'''' mother is sleeping.

== How adjectives become nouns ==

Most adjectives become nouns by adding the [[suffix]] '''ness'''. Example: Take the adjective 'natural', add 'ness' to get 'naturalness', a noun. To see a list of 100 adjectives used in [[Basic English]], [[adjective#100 adjectives used in Basic English|click here]]

== Plural Nouns ==
The plural form of most nouns is created simply by adding the letter ''s.''
* more than one snake = snakes
* more than one ski = skis
* more than one Barrymore = Barrymores
*

Note that some dictionaries list "busses" as an acceptable plural for "bus." Presumably, this is because the plural "buses" looks like it ought to rhyme with the plural of "fuse," which is "fuses." "Buses" is still listed as the preferable plural form. "Busses" is the plural, of course, for "buss," a seldom used word for "kiss."

There are several nouns that have irregular plural forms. Plurals formed in this way are sometimes called '''mutated (or mutating) plurals'''.
** more than one child = children
** more than one woman = women
** more than one man = men
** more than one person = people
** more than one goose = geese
** more than one mouse = mice
** more than one barracks = barracks
** more than one deer = deer
And, finally, there are nouns that maintain their Latin or Greek form in the plural. (See media and data and alumni, below.)
** more than one nucleus = nuclei
** more than one syllabus = syllabi
** more than one focus = foci
** more than one fungus = fungi
** more than one cactus = cacti (''cactuses'' is acceptable)
** more than one thesis = theses
** more than one crisis = crises*
** more than one phenomenon = phenomena
** more than one index = indices (''indexes'' is acceptable)
** more than one appendix = appendices (''appendixes'' is acceptable)
** more than one criterion = criteria
**

The words '''nature''' and '''natural''' are used for all the things that are normally not made by [[human]]s. Things like [[weather]], [[organisms]], [[landform]]s, [[celestial bodies]] and much more are part of nature. [[Scientist]]s study the way the parts of nature work. Things that have been made by people are said to be [[man-made]] or called [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]].

There are [[natural sciences]] that study different parts of nature, for example the science of [[ecology]] is about plants and animals as a whole, while [[biology]] studies every type of living thing.

From one point of view, humans are a prime example of nature, and are the most widely studied natural inhabitants of the planet earth. Humans interact with each other in their natural environment on a constant basis. Every part of nature {{ndash}} everything from the air to the dirt on the ground {{ndash}} is interdependent. [[Medicine]] studies humans in health and sickness. 

From another point of view, humans and nature can be said to be in [[conflict]]. Nature is often seen by humans as [[natural resource]]s. People cut down trees to get [[wood]] to burn, to build [[house]]s, or to make a place to grow food. [[Fire]]s, [[car]]s, and [[factories]] make a lot of smoke and harm many places. People who like to leave nature unharmed and those who feel they need to use more of nature often fight about what they should do. In the modern world, with many more people and many big cities, these problems are becoming more serious.

Nature, in the broadest sense, means the physical world as a whole. This is the meaning that [[physics]], the study of nature (etymologically), takes.

== Natural ==
A useful definition of ''natural'' is 
:"Happening or operating in accordance with the ordinary course of nature". ''Oxford Shorter English Dictionary'' says the word in this sense is first found in 1477.

[[Category:Bionics]][[Image:Windmills D1-D4 - Thornton Bank.jpg|thumb|150px|The natural resource of wind powers these 5MW wind turbines on this [[wind farm]] in [[Belgium]]]]

A '''natural resource''' is anything that people can use which comes from [[nature]]. People do not make natural resources, but gather them from the earth. Examples of natural resources are [[air]], [[water]], [[wood]], [[Crude oil|oil]], [[wind energy]],  [[iron]], and [[coal]]. Refined oil and [[hydro-electric energy]] are not natural resources because people make them.

== Supply ==
We often say there are two sorts of natural resources: renewable resources and non-renewable resources.
*A [[renewable resource]] is one which can be used again and again. For example, [[soil]], [[sunlight]] and [[water]] are renewable resources. However, in some circumstances, even water is not renewable easily. [[Wood]] is a renewable resource, but it takes time to renew and in some places people use the land for something else. Soil, if it blows away, is not easy to renew.
*A [[non-renewable resource]] is a resource that does not grow and come back, or a resource that would take a very long time to come back. For example, [[coal]] is a non-renewable resource. When we use coal, there is less coal afterward. One day, there will be no more of it to make [[Product (consumer goods)|goods]]. The non-renewable resource can be used directly (for example, burning oil to cook), or we can find a renewable resource to use (for example, using wind energy to make [[electricity]] to cook).  

Most natural resources are limited. This means they will eventually run out. A perpetual resource has a never-ending supply. Some examples of perpetual resources include [[solar energy]], [[tidal energy]], and [[wind energy]].<ref>ASTM E60 ''E2114-08 Standard terminology for sustainability'', ASTM, 2008, pp. 611-618 ISBN 978-0-8031-572</ref> 

Some of the things influencing supply of resources include whether it is able to be [[Recycling|recycled]], and the availability of suitable substitutes for the material. Non-renewable resources cannot be recycled. For example, oil, minerals, and other non-renewable resources cannot be recycled.

== Demand ==
The [[demand]] for resources can change with new [[technology]], new needs, and new [[economics]] (e.g. changes in cost of the resources). Some material can go completely out of use, if people do not want it any more. Demand of many natural resources is very high, but availability of some, such as [[precious metal]]s, is very low. 

== Availability ==
All places have their own natural resources. When people do not have a certain resource they need, they can either replace it with another resource, or [[trade]] with another country to get the resource.  People have sometimes [[war|fought]] to have them (for example, [[spice]]s, water, arable land, [[gold]], or [[petroleum]]).

When people do not have some natural resources, their quality of life can get lower. So, we need to protect our resources from pollution. For example, when they can not get clean water, people may become [[disease|ill]]; if there is not enough wood, trees will be cut and the forest will disappear over time ([[deforestation]]); if there are not enough fish in a sea, people can die of [[starvation]].  Renewable resources include [[crop]]s, wind, hydroelectric power, fish, and sunlight. Many people carefully save their natural resources so others can use them in future.

[[Category:Economics]]'''Negentropy''' is reverse [[entropy]]. It means things becoming more in order. By 'order' is meant organisation, [[structure]] and [[function]]: the opposite of [[randomness]] or [[chaos]]. One example of negentropy is a star system such as the [[Solar System]]. Another example is [[life]].

As a general rule, everything in the [[universe]] tends towards [[entropy]]. [[Star system]]s eventually become dead. All energy has gone, and everything in the system is ''at the temperature of the surrounding space''. The opposite of entropy is negentropy. It is a [[temporary]] condition in which certain things are hotter and more highly organised than the surrounding space. This is the [[second law of thermodynamics]]:
:The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated [[system]] always increases over time.<ref>It remains constant in ideal cases where the system is in a steady state or undergoing a reversible process. The increase in entropy accounts for the irreversibility of natural processes, and the [[asymmetry]] between future and past.</ref>

[[Life]] is considered to be '''negentropic''' because it takes things in which have less order, like dead [[food]], and turns it into things with more order, like [[cell]]s in the [[body]], [[tissue (biological)|tissues]], and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]]. In doing so, it gives off [[heat]].  Another example of negentropic things are [[Society|societies]], or social [[Systems theory|systems]], because they take disorderly things such as [[Communication|communications]], and make them into order which is useful to people.

<!-- interwiki -->[[File:LocationNorthAmerica.png|thumbnail|250px|[[World]] [[map]] showing where North America is]] 
'''North America''' is a [[continent]] in the [[Northern hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Western hemisphere]]s of [[Earth]]. It is to the east of the [[Pacific Ocean]], the West of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the South of the [[Arctic Ocean]], and the North of [[South America]]. It is the northern part of [[the Americas]]. The southernmost part is [[Central America]]. 

Hundreds of millions of years ago, North America was part of a larger ancient supercontinent named [[Laurasia]]. A few million years ago, a new [[land bridge]] arose and connected North America to South America. [[Beringia]] connected North America to [[Siberia]] a few times during [[ice age]]s in the past 20,000 years. North America has a population of 527 million and is the 4th most populous continent.

==Countries==
North America includes these large countries, listed from North to South:
* {{flagicon|Canada}} [[Canada]]
* {{flagicon|Greenland}} [[Greenland]], ruled by [[Denmark]], (A large island to the northeast of Canada, and is also considered part of North America)
* {{flagicon|United States}} [[United States|United States of America]]

'''Neptune''' ({{IPAEng|ˈnɛp.tjun}}), is the eighth and last [[planet]] from the [[Sun]] in the [[Solar System]]. It is a [[gas giant]]. It is the fourth largest planet and third [[weight|heaviest]]. Neptune has four rings which are hard to see from the Earth. It is 17 times heavier than [[Earth]] and is a little bit heavier than [[Uranus]]. It was named after the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[Neptune (mythology)|God of the Sea]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nineplanets.org/neptune.html |title=Neptune |author= |date= |work= |publisher=nineplanets.org |accessdate=5 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question48.html |title=StarChild Question of the Month for August 2002 |author= |date=August 2002 |work= |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=5 November 2010}}</ref>

Neptune's [[atmosphere]] is mostly made up of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]. It also contains small amounts of [[methane]] which makes the planet appear blue. Neptune's [[blue]] color is much brighter compared to [[Uranus (planet)|Uranus']], which has a similar amount of methane, so there might be another reason why Neptune is blue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Neptune |title=Neptune |author= |date= |work= |publisher=NASA |accessdate=11 November 2010}}</ref> Neptune also has the strongest winds of any planet in the solar system, measured as high as 2,100&nbsp;km/h or 1,300&nbsp;mph.<ref name="Suomi1991">{{cite journal

Neptune was discovered by the [[astronomer]]s, [[Urbain Le Verrier]] and [[John Couch Adams]]. They were both [[honor]]ed for the discovery. The planet was the first to be discovered by mathematical calculations instead of using a [[telescope]]. Because of [[Uranus]]' odd movements in its orbit (the line which a planet follows in moving), it made astronomers search for the new planet. The planet was visited by only one spacecraft, ''[[Voyager 2]]'' on August 25, 1989. Neptune once had a huge storm known as the "Great Dark Spot" which was discovered in 1989 by Voyager 2. However, the dark spot was not seen in 1994, and new spots were found since then. It is not known why the dark spot disappeared.  Visits by more [[space probe]]s have been proposed.

== History ==
=== Discovery ===
[[Image:Urbain Le Verrier.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Urbain Le Verrier, the co-discoverer of Neptune.]]
The first possible sighting of Neptune is thought to be by [[Galileo]] as his drawings showed Neptune near [[Jupiter]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Hirschfeld |first=Alan |authorlink= |title=Parallax:The Race to Measure the Cosmos |year=2001 |publisher=Henry Holt |location=New York, New York |isbn=0-8050-7133-4}}</ref> But Galileo was not credited for the discovery since he thought Neptune was a "fixed [[star]]" instead of a planet. Because of Neptune's slow movement across the sky, Galileo's small telescope was not strong enough to detect Neptune as a planet.<ref name="Neptune">{{cite web |publisher=Crystal Links |title=Neptune |url=http://www.crystalinks.com/neptune.html |accessdate=2007-6-10}}</ref>

In 1821, [[Alexis Bouvard]] published the astronomical tables of the [[orbit]] of [[Uranus]].<ref>A. Bouvard (1821), ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1821tapp.book.....B&db_key=AST&data_type=HTML&format=&high=44b52c369020669 Tables astronomiques publiées par le Bureau des Longitudes de France]'',kikin, FR: Bachelier</ref> Later observations showed that Uranus was moving in an irregular way in its orbit, making some astronomers think of another large body being the cause of the irregular motions of Uranus. In 1843, [[John Couch Adams]] calculated the orbit of an eighth planet that would possibly be influencing the orbit of Uranus. He sent his calculations to Sir [[George Airy]], the [[Astronomer Royal]], who asked Adams for an explanation. Adams began to make a copy of the reply, but never sent it.

In 1846, [[Urbain Le Verrier]], who was not working with Adams, created his own calculations but also had problems in encouraging any interest with his people. However, in the same year, [[John Herschel]] began to support the mathematical method and encouraged [[James Challis]] to search for the planet. After much delays, Challis began his unwilling search in July 1846. Meanwhile, [[Urbain Le Verrier|Le Verrier]] had convinced [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] to search for the planet.

Although [[Heinrich d'Arrest]] was still a student at the [[Berlin Observatory]], he suggested that a newly drawn map of the sky, in the region of Le Verrier's predicted area, could be compared with the current sky to look for the displacement characteristic of a [[planet]], as compared to a fixed star. Neptune was then discovered that very night on September 23, 1846, within 1° of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, and about 10° from Adams' prediction. Challis later found out that he had seen the planet twice in August, failing to recognize it owing to his careless approach to the work.

After the news of the discovery of Neptune spread, there was also a lot of arguing between the French and the British about who was to be deserved credit for the discovery. Later, an international agreement decided that both Le Verrier and Adams together deserved credit. However, historians are now reviewing  the topic after the rediscovery in 1998 of the "Neptune papers" (historical documents from the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]]), which had seemingly been stolen by astronomer [[Olin Eggen]] for nearly three decades and were only rediscovered (in his ownership) right after his death.<ref name='Neptdisc'>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/nk/neptune/index.htm |title=Neptune's Discovery.

=== Naming ===
Shortly after its discovery, Neptune was temporarily called "the planet exterior to Uranus" or "Le Verrier's planet". The first suggestion for a name came from Galle. He proposed the name ''[[Janus]]''. In England, Challis suggested the name ''[[Oceanus]]''. In France, [[François Jean Dominique Arago|Arago]] suggested that the new planet be called ''Leverrier'', a suggestion which was met with a lot of opposition outside [[France]]. French almanacs promptly reintroduced the name ''Herschel'' for ''Uranus'' and ''Leverrier'' for the new planet.

Meanwhile, on separate and different reason, Adams suggested changing the name ''Georgian'' to ''Uranus'', while Leverrier (through the Board of Longitude) suggested ''Neptune'' for the new planet. [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve|Struve]]<!--- (1793–1864), or maybe his son Otto Wilhelm von Struve (1819–1905) ---> gave support of that name on December 29, 1846, to the [[Saint Petersburg]] Academy of Sciences.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/AN.../0025//0000164.000.html |title=Second report of proceedings in the Cambridge Observatory relating to the new Planet (Neptune) |year=1847 |journal=Astronomische Nachrichten |volume=25 |pages=309 |last=Hind |first=J. R.}} Smithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS).</ref> Soon ''Neptune'' was internationally agreed among many people and was then the official name for the new planet. In [[Roman mythology]], [[Neptune (god)|Neptune]] was the god of the sea, identified with the Greek god, [[Poseidon]].

== Structure ==
=== Mass and composition ===
At 10.243{{e|25}}&nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]], Neptune's mass puts the planet between [[Earth]] and the largest gas giants; Neptune has seventeen Earth masses but just 1/18th the mass of [[Jupiter]]. Neptune and [[Uranus]] are often considered to be part of a sub-class of gas giant known as "''ice giants''", given their smaller size and big differences in composition compared to [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]. In the search for [[extrasolar planets]], Neptune has been used as a reference to determine the size and structure of the discovered planet. Some discovered planets that have similar masses like Neptune are often called "Neptunes".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1965.html |title=Trio of Neptunes |publisher=Astrobiology Magazine |date= May 21, 2006 |accessdate=2007-8-6}}</ref> just as astronomers refer to various extra-solar "Jupiters."

The atmosphere of Neptune is made up mostly of hydrogen, with a smaller amount of helium. A tiny amount of methane is also detected in the atmosphere. Important absorption bands of methane happen at wavelengths above 600&nbsp;nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. This absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane gives Neptune its blue hue.<ref>{{cite web

Because Neptune orbits so far from the [[Sun]], it gets very little heat with the uppermost regions of the atmosphere at −218&nbsp;°C (55&nbsp;K). Deeper inside the layers of gas, however, the temperature rises slowly. Like Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the differences are larger: Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is strong enough to create the fastest winds seen in the Solar System. Several possible explanations have been suggested, including [[radiogenic]] heating from the planet's core, the continued radiation into space of leftover heat made by [[Accretion theory|infalling matter]] during the planet's birth, and [[gravity wave]]s breaking above the [[tropopause]].<ref>
McHugh, J. P., [http://www.aas.org/publications/baas/v31n4/dps99/572.htm Computation of Gravity Waves near the Tropopause], ''AAS/Division for Planetary Sciences Meeting Abstracts'', p. 53.07, September 1999</ref><ref>McHugh, J. P. and Friedson, A. J., Neptune's Energy Crisis: Gravity Wave Heating of the Stratosphere of Neptune, ''Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society'', p.1078, September, 1996</ref>

The structure of the inside of Neptune is thought to be very similar to the structure of the inside of Uranus. There is likely to be a [[planetary core|core]], thought to be about 15 Earth masses, made up of molten rock and metal surrounded by a mixture of rock, water, ammonia, and methane. The heavy pressures keep the icy part of this surrounding mixture as solids, in spite of the large temperatures near the core. The atmosphere, extending about 10 to 20% of the way towards the center, is mostly hydrogen and helium at high altitudes. More mixtures of methane, ammonia, and water are found in the lower areas of the atmosphere. Very slowly this darker and hotter area blends into the superheated liquid interior. The pressure at the center of Neptune is millions of times more than that on the surface of [[Earth]]. Comparing its rotational speed to its degree of [[oblateness]] shows that it has its mass less concentrated towards the center unlike Uranus.

=== Weather and magnetic field ===
One difference between Neptune and Uranus is the level of {{broken wikt link|meteorology|meteorological}} activity that has been observed (seen or measured). When the Voyager spacecraft flew by [[Uranus]] in 1986, that winds on that planet were observed to be mild. When Voyager flew by Neptune in 1989, powerful weather events were observed. The weather of Neptune has extremely active storm systems. Its [[atmosphere]] has the highest wind speeds in the solar system, thought to be powered by the flow of internal heat. Regular winds in the equatorial region have speeds of around 1,200&nbsp;km/h (750&nbsp;mph), while winds in storm systems can reach up to 2,100&nbsp;km/h, near-[[supersonic]] speeds.<ref name="Hammel1989">{{cite journal

In 1989, the [[Great Dark Spot]], a [[tropical cyclone|cyclonic storm]] system the size of [[Eurasia]], was discovered by [[NASA]]'s ''[[Voyager 2]]'' spacecraft. The storm resembled the [[Great Red Spot]] of [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. However, on November 2, 1994, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] did not see the Great Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in the planet's northern hemisphere. The reason why the Great Dark Spot has disappeared is unknown. One possible theory is that heat transfer from the planet's core disrupted the atmospheric balance and existing circulation patterns. The '''Scooter''' is another storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. Its nickname was given when it was first noticed in the months leading up to the ''Voyager'' encounter in 1989: it moved faster than the Great Dark Spot. Later images showed clouds that moved even faster than Scooter. The [[Wizard's eye]]/''Dark Spot 2'' is another southern cyclonic storm, the second most strongest storm seen during the 1989 encounter. It originally was completely dark, but as ''Voyager'' came closer to the planet, a bright core developed and is seen in most of the highest resolution images.

Unlike other gas giants, Neptune's atmosphere shows the presence of high clouds making shadows on a thick cloud deck below. Though Neptune's atmosphere is much more active than that of Uranus, both planets are made up of the same gases and ices. Uranus and Neptune are not exactly the same type of gas giants like to Jupiter and Saturn, but are rather ice giants, meaning they have a larger solid core and are also made of ices. Neptune is very cold, with temperatures as low as −224&nbsp;°C (−372&nbsp;°F or 49&nbsp;K) recorded at the cloud tops in 1989.

Neptune also has similarities with Uranus in its [[magnetosphere]], with a [[magnetic field]] strongly tilted comparative to its [[rotation]]al axis at 47° and offset at least 0.55&nbsp;radii (about 13,500&nbsp;kilometres) from the planet's physical center. Comparing the magnetic fields of the two planets, scientists think the extreme course may be characteristic of flows in the interior of the planet and not the result of Uranus' sideways rotational movement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Neptune's Rings ==
{{mainarticle|Rings of Neptune}}
[[File:Neptune rings PIA02224.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Neptune's Rings]]

Very small blue colored rings have been discovered around the blue planet, but they are not as well known as the rings of [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]. When these rings were discovered by a team led by [[Edward Guinan]], originally they thought that the rings may not be complete rings. However, this was proven wrong by ''Voyager 2''. Neptune's [[planetary ring]]s have a weird "clumpy" arrangement. Although the cause is currently unknown but some scientists think that it may be because of the gravitational contact with small moons that orbit near them.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Proof that the rings are incomplete first began in the mid-1980s, when [[occultation|stellar occultation]] were found to rarely show an extra "blink" just before or after the planet occulted the star. Pictures from ''Voyager 2'' in 1989 solved the problem, when the ring system was found to have several faint rings. The farthest ring, Adams, has three famous arcs now named ''Liberté'', ''Egalité'', and ''Fraternité'' (Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity).

The existence of arcs is very hard to understand because the laws of motion would predict that arcs spread out into a single ring in a very short time. The gravitational effects of [[Galatea (moon)|Galatea]], a moon just inward from the ring, are now thought to have created the arcs.

Several other rings were discovered by the ''Voyager'' cameras. Also with the thin [[John Couch Adams|Adams]] Ring about 63,000&nbsp;km from the center of Neptune, the [[Urbain Le Verrier|Leverrier]] Ring is at 53,000&nbsp;km and the wider, smaller [[Johann Gottfried Galle|Galle]] Ring is at 42,000&nbsp;km. A very small outward expansion to the Leverrier Ring has been named [[William Lassell|Lassell]]; it is surrounded at its outer edge by the [[François Arago|Arago]] Ring at 57,000&nbsp;km.<ref>[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/append8.html Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature Ring and Ring Gap Nomenclature (December 8, 2004)]. ''USGS - Astrogeology Research Program''.</ref>

New Earth-based observations published in 2005 appeared to show that Neptune's rings are a lot more unstable than thought before. To be exact, it looks like that the ''Liberté'' ring might disappear maybe quickly in less than 100 years. The new observations seems to puzzle our understanding of Neptune's rings into a lot of confusion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newscientist.com/channel/space/mg18524925.900 |title=Neptune's rings are fading away |date=March 26, 2005 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate= 2007-8-6 }}</ref>

== Neptune's Moons ==
{{mainarticle|List of Neptune's moons}}

Neptune has a total of 14 known [[Satellite (natural)|moons]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23318301 |title=Nasa's Hubble telescope discovers new Neptune moon |first= |last= |work=bbc.co.uk |year=15 July 2013 |accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref> As Neptune was the Roman god of the sea, the planet's moons were named after lesser sea gods or goddesses. The largest, and the only one big enough to have the shape of a [[sphere]] is [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], (pronounced:{{IPA|ˈtraɪtən}}) discovered by [[William Lassell]] just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself. Unlike all other large planetary moons, Triton has a [[retrograde orbit]], showing that the moon was probably captured, and maybe was once a [[Kuiper belt]] object. It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a [[synchronous orbit]], and is slowly moving into Neptune and will one day be torn apart when it passes the [[Roche limit]]. Triton is the coldest object that has been measured in the solar system, with temperatures of −235&nbsp;°C (38&nbsp;K, −392&nbsp;°F). Its diamter is 2700&nbsp;km, (80% of Earth's Moon, Luna), its mass is 2.15×1022&nbsp;kg (30% of Luna), its orbital diameter is 354,800&nbsp;km (90% of Luna) and its orbital period is 5.877 days (20% of Luna).

Neptune's second known moon (by order of distance), the odd moon [[Nereid (moon)|Nereid]], has one of the most unusual orbits of any satellite in the [[solar system]].

From July to September 1989, ''Voyager 2'' discovered six new moons of Neptune. Of these, the lumpy-shaped [[Proteus (moon)|Proteus]] is the biggest known object that has not been shaped into a sphere by its own gravity. Although it is the second most massive Neptunian moon, it has only one quarter of one percent of the mass of Triton. Neptune's closest four moons, [[Naiad (moon)|Naiad]], [[Thalassa (moon)|Thalassa]], [[Despina (moon)|Despina]], and [[Galatea (moon)|Galatea]], orbit close enough to be inside Neptune's rings.

The next farthest out, [[Larissa (moon)|Larissa]] was originally discovered in 1981 when it had occulted a star. The moon was credited for causing Neptune's ring arcs when ''Voyager 2'' observed Neptune in 1989. Five new unusual moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Holman, Matthew J.

== Observation ==
Neptune cannot be seen with [[naked eye]] alone, since Neptune's normal brightness are between [[Apparent magnitude|magnitudes]] +7.7 and +8.0,<ref name="Neptune"/> which can be out-shined by [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]'s Galilean moons, the [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], and the [[asteroid]]s [[4 Vesta]], [[2 Pallas]], [[7 Iris]], [[3 Juno]] and [[6 Hebe]]. A telescope or strong binoculars will show Neptune as a small blue dot, similar in appearance to Uranus. The blue color comes from the [[methane]] in its atmosphere.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Data Book of Astronomy | author=Moore, Patrick |year=2000 |pages=207}}</ref> Its small obvious size has made it difficult to study visually; most telescopic data was quite limited until the arrival of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] and large ground-based telescopes with [[adaptive optics]].

With an [[orbital period]] ([[sidereal period]]) of 164.88&nbsp;[[Julian calendar|Julian years]], Neptune will soon return (for discovery) to the same place in the sky where it was discovered in 1846. This will happen three different times, also with a fourth in which it will come very close to being at that position. These are April 11, 2009, when it will be in [[Prograde and retrograde motion|prograde motion]]; July 17, 2009, when it will be in [[Prograde and retrograde motion|retrograde motion]]; and February 7, 2010, when it will be in prograde motion. It will also come very close to being at the same point since the 1846 discovery in late October through early-mid November 2010, when Neptune will turn from retrograde to direct motion on the exact degree of Neptune's discovery and will then stop for a moment along the ecliptic within 2 arc minutes at that point (closest on November 7, 2010). This will be the last time for about the next 165 years that Neptune will be at its point of discovery.

This is explained by the idea of [[retrogradation]]. Like all planets and asteroids in the Solar System beyond Earth, Neptune goes through [[retrogradation]] at certain points during its [[Orbital period|synodic period]]. In addition to the start of retrogradation, other events inside the synodic period include [[astronomical opposition]], the return to [[prograde and retrograde motion|prograde motion]], and [[Conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] to the Sun.

In its orbit around the Sun, Neptune returned to its original point of discovery in August 2011.<ref name="Neptune"/>

== Exploration ==
{{mainarticle|Exploration of Neptune}}
[[File:Voyager.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Voyager 2]].]]

Currently, only one spacecraft has visited Neptune. [[NASA]]'s ''[[Voyager 2]]'' probe made a quick flyby of the planet with its closest encounter on August 25, 1989, and was the last planet to have been visited by at least one spacecraft.

Some of ''Voyager 2''"s important discoveries was its very close fly-by of [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] where took pictures of several parts of the moon. The probe also discovered the [[Great Dark Spot]], although it has now disappeared after when the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] took pictures of Neptune in 1994. Originally thought to be a large cloud or cyclonic storm system, it was later guessed just to be a hole in the visible cloud deck.

Neptune turned out to have the strongest winds of all the solar system's gas giants. In the outer regions of the solar system, where the Sun shines over 1000 times fainter than on Earth (still very bright with a magnitude of -21), the last of the four giants did happen as what the scientists actually expected. One might think that the farther a planet is from the Sun, the less energy and heat there would be to create and run the very strong winds around. The winds on [[Jupiter]] were already hundreds of kilometres per hour. Rather than seeing slower winds, the scientists found faster winds (over 1600&nbsp;km/h) on more distant Neptune.

One possible guess for the cause of the faster wind speeds is that if enough energy is produced, [[turbulence]] is created, which slows the winds down (like those of Jupiter). At Neptune however, there is so little solar energy that once winds are started they meet very little resistance, and are able to keep very high speeds. Anyhow, Neptune gives out more energy than it gets from the Sun,<ref name="Beebe1992">{{cite journal

'''Negative''' may mean:

*Something negative can be something bad.
*A [[negative number]] is a number that is less than zero. 5 - 8 = -3.
*Some people also use ''negative'' the same way as "[[no]]", or other related words. "Not", "Never", "Nowhere" etc. are all negative words. On [[two-way radio]]s the word "negative" is used instead of "no" to be clearer. 
*In [[film photography]], a ''[[negative film]]'' is an exposed [[picture]] or [[movie]] film that has been [[wikt:process|processed]], and is ready to be used to make a [[wikt:print|print]]. In a negative, everything in the picture has the opposite color. Things that are white will be black, things that are red will be green, and things that are orange will be blue.
*[[Negative binary numbers]]
*[[Negative charge]]
*[[Negative exponent]]
*[[Negative feedback]], a basic concept of cybernetics; it is the basis of regulation and control. It is important in engineering and physiology. In biology and physiology negative feedback is known as homeostasis
*[[Negative gravity]]

{{disambiguation}}'''Now''' is the [[time span]] between the [[past]] and the [[future]]. It can be long (like an [[eon]] in [[geologic time]]) or short (like a [[picosecond]]) but it is almost always used to refer to the span between the present instant to some [[time horizon]] when a [[choice|decision]] must be made. It can be used to ask or demand that someone make a decision even if they want to delay.

"I want to know what you think, now."

"What do you think now?"

"Now is the time for all good people to come to the aid of their country."

[[Mathematics]] and [[measurement]] assume that everything used in one [[equation]] [[equals]] the same quantities at the beginning of [[calculation]] or [[axiomatization]] as at the end. That means it is mathematically correct to say that the idea of "[[equal]]" means "equal from the time the [[wikt:process|process]] starts to the time it ends." In [[General Semantics]] and [[E Prime]] the words [[equal]], [[remain]] (for the past until '''now''') and [[become]] (for '''now''' into the future) replace the [[verb]] "[[to be]]" for this reason.

[[Algebra]] is now often called '''snapshot algebra''' or '''algebra of seeing''' because of this dependence on time. If any [[action]] or [[event]] were possible between steps in algebraic analysis, then, in theory, one would have to start over as if one had no knowledge of the new state at all. For these reasons the idea of [[statistics]] and also [[knowledge]] and [[knowledge management]] are sometimes questioned, for instance, in the book ''[[Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics]]''. A major issue is the comparing of numbers gathered in the past, and '''now''', after some key conditions change.

'''New York City''' is the largest [[city]] in the [[United States]] and [[New York]]. Over 8 million people live in it, and over 22 million people live in and around it. It is in the state of [[New York]], which is in the [[northeastern United States]]. It is the financial capital of the US since it is home to the nation's [[stock market]], [[Wall Street]], and the [[One World Trade Center]].  It is also the home of the [[UN Headquarters]]. Due to its importance in [[finance]] as well as [[diplomacy]], it is sometimes considered to be the financial capital as well as the cultural center of the world.

== History ==
The oldest [[Borough|part]] of the city, the island of [[Manhattan]], still has its original [[Lenape]] [[Native American]] name. Although Native people such as the Lenape and Canarsees had lived there for many thousands of years, New York City was first explored by [[Europe]]ans in the 1500s.  [[Florence|Florentine]] explorer [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] found the entrance to New York Harbor in the year 1524 and English explorer [[Henry Hudson]] named the [[Hudson River]] in 1609.

New York City was settled by Europeans from [[The Netherlands]] in 1624. The Dutch called the whole area of New York '''"Nieuw Nederland"''' ([[New Netherland]]) and they named a [[fort]] and town on the south end of Manhattan Island '''Nieuw Amsterdam''' (New [[Amsterdam]]),<ref name=nieuw>{{cite book | last=Rubin | first=Susan Goldman | year=2004 | title=L'Chaim!: To Jewish Life in America! | publisher=Harry N. Adams in association with The Jewish Museum | isbn=0810950359 }}</ref> after the capital city of the Netherlands, which was to become present-day New York. The English took over the colony in 1664 during the second [[Anglo-Dutch War]]. They changed the name to '''New York''', to honor the [[Duke of York]], who later became King [[James II]] of [[England]].  The Dutch surrendered Nieuw Amsterdam without fighting. They were afraid of the English [[Royal Navy]], so they traded the town to England for the colony of [[Surinam]] in [[South America]], which they thought was worth more money.

By the time the English took New York, there were many other Dutch towns in what would become New York City, including Breukelen ([[Brooklyn]]), Vlissingen ([[Flushing]]), and Nieuw Haarlem ([[Harlem]]). There were already some English towns in the area also, such as Gravesend in Brooklyn and Newtown in Queens. [[Dutch people|Dutch]], English and other people had been living together in New York for a long time.

New York quickly grew to become a large and important port city.  The  important [[Battle of Long Island]] of the [[American Revolution]] was fought in Brooklyn in 1776. New York was the capital of the United States under the [[Articles of Confederation]] from 1785 to 1788.  When the [[US Constitution]] was made, it stayed as the capital from 1789 until 1790.<ref>[http://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_item/Nine_Capitals_of_the_United_States.htm The Nine Capitals of the United States]. United States Senate Historical Office. Accessed June 9, 2005. Based on Fortenbaugh, Robert, ''The Nine Capitals of the United States'', York, PA: Maple Press, 1948.</ref>

In 1898, the cities of New York and Brooklyn came together with the Bronx, Staten Island, and the western towns in Queens County to make Greater New York. This is the total area of the City of New York today.  Around this time, many new [[immigrant]]s came into New York City.  They came in at [[Ellis Island]], an island in New York's harbor near the [[Statue of Liberty]].  Many of them then moved to the [[Lower East Side]] neighborhood in Manhattan, which had over a million people living in just a few square miles.

Early in the twentieth century, with better transportation, more people moved to the new parts of the greater city, and many commuted to Manhattan. Many [[skyscraper]]s and other big buildings were put up to provide places to work.

== Geography ==
[[File:USA grants tomb.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Grant's Tomb]], Manhattan]]

Most of New York City is on three islands near the [[Atlantic Ocean]], although one part is on the mainland of [[North America]]. The city includes all of [[Manhattan|Manhattan Island]] and [[Staten Island]], and the western end of [[Long Island]]. There are also many smaller islands.

The city is divided into five major parts called ''boroughs''. Each one is also a county. They are:

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! Boroughs !! Notes
|-
| [[Manhattan]] || (New York County, on Manhattan Island)
|-
| [[Brooklyn]] || (Kings County, on Long Island)
|-
| [[The Bronx]] || (Bronx County, on the mainland)
|-
| [[Queens]] || (Queens County, on Long Island)
|-
| [[Staten Island]] || (Richmond County, on Staten Island)
|}

Water divides several parts of the city. Part of the [[Hudson River]] forms the border between Manhattan and the Bronx on one side, and the State of [[New Jersey]] on the other side. The [[East River]] forms the border between Manhattan on one side, and Brooklyn and Queens on the other side. The Harlem River forms the border between Manhattan and the Bronx (except for a small part of Manhattan that is on the mainland). Part of [[Long Island Sound]] separates the Bronx and Queens. Newtown Creek is part of the border between Brooklyn and Queens. Some parts of the city are very separate from the others because of water, such as [[Rockaway]] in Queens and [[City Island]] in the Bronx. A small piece of land in Manhattan is international territory and belongs to the [[United Nations Headquarters]].

The hallmark of New York city is its many [[skyscraper]]s, especially in Manhattan. In New York City there are about 5600 skyscrapers. 48 of them are over 200 metres tall, which is the highest number of skyscrapers in one area in the world.

=== Climate ===
New York's climate is between [[humid subtropical]] and humid [[continental climate|continental]]. The hottest temperature ever in New York City is 106&nbsp;°F and the coldest temperature ever is -13&nbsp;°F. In 2012, [[Hurricane Sandy (2012)|Hurricane Sandy]] hit New York City, causing part of Manhattan to lose [[electricity|power]]. New York City gets some [[snow]] in winter.

'''October''' is the tenth [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], coming between [[September]] and [[November]]. It has 31 [[day]]s. The name comes from the [[Latin]] ''oct'' for "eight". It was the eighth month of the year before [[January]] and [[February]] were added to the beginning of the year.

== The Month ==
[[File:Hapgood Pond - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|180px|right|October is an [[Autumn]] (Fall) month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], as shown here in [[Vermont]].]]
October is the tenth month of the year in the [[Gregorian calendar]], coming after [[September]] and before [[November]]. It has 31 days. Its name comes from Latin ''oct'', meaning [[eight]], as it was the eighth month of the year in the Old Roman [[Calendar]] before [[January]] and [[February]] were added to the beginning of the year, though its name did not change. The tenth month at the time was [[December]].

October is an [[Autumn]] (Fall) month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and a [[Spring]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. In each [[Hemisphere]], it is the [[season]]al equivalent of [[April]] in the other.

October begins on the same day of week as [[January]] in [[common year]]s, but no month begins on the same day as October in a [[leap year]]. It always ends on the same day of the [[week]] as [[February]], though also ends on the same day of the week as [[January]] in [[common year]]s.

[[October 31]]/[[November 1]] is [[Samhain]] in old [[Pagan]] tradition. Several current observances at this time are believed to be related to it. They are: [[Halloween]] ([[October 31]]) in many western traditions, [[All Saints Day]] ([[November 1]]), All Souls Day ([[November 2]]), and the [[All Saints Day|Day of the Dead]] ([[October 31]] to [[November 2]]), which is celebrated in [[Mexico]].

October's [[flower]] is the [[Calendula]]. One of its [[birthstone]]s is the [[opal]]. The meaning of the opal is hope. The other birthstone of October is the [[pink tourmaline]]. The [[Astrology|astrological]] signs for October are [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]] ([[September 24]] to [[October 23]]) and [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]] ([[October 24]] to [[November 22]]).

[[File:En-us-One.ogg|thumb|right|Pronunciation of the number 1.]]
'''One''' ('''1''') is a [[natural number]] after [[zero]] and before [[2 (number)|two]].
It represents a single item.
A [[human]] typically has one {[[head]], [[nose]], [[mouth]], and [[umbilicus|navel]] (belly-button)}.
The [[Roman numeral]] is I.

== Mathematics ==
In mathematics, one is also the only number with this special fact: Any number multiplied by 1 equals that number.
Then, the number 1 divides any number but it is not divided by any except itself. The number 1 divides any number to give that same number but it cannot be divided by any other number to give one as the answer. Let ''n'' be any number. Then ''n''/1 = ''n'' but 1/''n'' is never 1 (when n is not 1). Example: 7/1 = 7 but 1/7 is not 1 but 0.142857 ...

Any number divided by itself always gives 1 as the answer. ''n''/''n'' = 1 (when n is not 0). Example: 7/7 = 1.

[[0.999...]] is a [[repeating decimal]] that is mathematically equal to 1. Many [[mathematical proof|proofs]] have been made to show this is correct.

== Computer science ==
The number one is important for [[computer science]] because it is, together with [[zero]], a part of the [[binary]] numeral system. In [[machine code]] and in lots of [[programming language]]s one means true. Zero means false.

== Other meanings ==
* In [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], one is the grade for "very good". It is the best grade of six possible grades in Germany and the best of five possible grades in Austria. In the [[Netherlands]], one is the lowest grade, and ten the highest and best. In [[Poland]], one is also the lowest grade, but the highest is six.
* In numerology, the number one is a symbol for everything ([[unity]]), the beginning, and [[God]].

[[Category:Square numbers]]'''O Canada''' is the [[national anthem]] of [[Canada]]. 

[[Calixa Lavallée]] wrote the music; [[Adolphe-Basile Routhier]] wrote the words in French. It was first sung in French in 1880. [[Robert Stanley Weir]] wrote English words for the song in 1908.

It was sung as the national anthem for many years before the government made it official in 1980. 

Here are the words, explained in [[Basic English|Simple English]]:

 O Canada! Our home and native land, 
 True patriot love in all thy sons command! 
 With glowing hearts we see thee rise 
 The True North strong and free, 
 From far and wide, O Canada, 
 We stand on guard for thee. 
 God keep our land glorious and free! 
 O Canada, we stand on guard for thee; 
 O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.

("Canada, our home and the country where we were born, you make all your people truly love you! With joy we watch you get better and better. You are the True North, strong and free. Our citizens come from all over the earth and we watch over you to keep you safe. God, please keep our land good and free! O Canada, we watch over you to keep you safe.")

Here are the words in French. The words in French and English do not mean the same thing.

 Ô Canada! Terre de nos aĩeux, 
 Ton front est ceint de fleurons glorieux! 
 Car ton bras sait porter l'épée, 
 Il sait porter la croix! 
 Ton histoire est une épopée 
 Des plus brillants exploits. 
 Et ta valeur de foi trempée 
 Protégera nos foyers et nos droits; 
 Protégera nos foyers et nos droits. 

("Canada, land of our parents and grandparents, you wear a crown of beautiful flowers! You can carry a sword, and you can carry a cross (for [[Christianity]]); your whole history is full of the great things you have done. You are brave and faithful, and this will protect our homes and our rights.")

'''Oahu''' (or '''Oʻahu''') is the third largest of the [[Hawaiian Islands]], in the [[United States]]. It means "the gathering place" (a place where people meet) in the [[Hawaiian language]]. Most of the people of Hawaii live there (1.2 million of the state's 1.7 million in the mid-1990s). The total land area is {{convert|608|mi2|km2}}. [[Honolulu]], the capital city of Hawaii, is on this island. Other well-known places on Oahu are [[Waikiki]], [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Diamond Head]], [[Hanauma Bay]], [[Kaneohe Bay]], and both the North Shore and Makaha (which are famous for very big ocean waves). 

[[Kamehameha I]] made Oahu his capital when he became the first king of Hawaii. [[Iolani Palace]] was built later on by others of the royal family. It is the only royal palace on American soil. 

Oahu was perhaps the first of the Hawaiian Islands which the crew of ''HMS Resolution'' saw on 18 January 1778. This was during Captain [[James Cook]]'s third [[Pacific Ocean]] trip. Europeans did not land on Oahu until 28 February 1779 when Captain Clerke of the ''HMS Resolution'' stepped ashore at [[Waimea Bay]]. Clerke took command of the ship after Captain Cook was killed at Kealakekua Bay on February 14.

Today, Oahu has become a tourism and shopping center. Almost 7 million visitors (mainly from the [[United States|American mainland]] and [[Japan]]) go there every year to enjoy the special island holiday found only in Hawaii.

Oahu can be seen in hundreds of movies and TV shows. Some of them are ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-O]]'' and ''[[Jake and the Fatman]]''.

Any [[Multimedia|media]] can be open content, from text and pictures to video and sound.

When someone creates something (like a [[picture]] or [[book]]), they can make that work "open".  This means that other people are allowed to copy it and change it if they want.  Something that is open content may be [[wikt:free|free]] of charge, but it does not have to be. 

The [[Simple English Wikipedia]] is open content. So are other [[Wikipedia]]s. If a person changes open content or makes new open content, everyone can give it to anyone else, or even sell it.

[[Category:Free content]]'''Orthography''' is an official or correct way to [[Writing|write]] a particular language. It includes rules of '''spelling'''.<ref>''Concise Oxford English Dictionary''. '''Orthography''': 1. Correct spelling; the way in which words are conventionally written. 2. That part of [[grammar]] which [deals with] the nature and values of letters and their combination. '''Spelling''': The action of expressing words by letters; or, naming the letters of words.</ref> Orthography may also include rules about [[punctuation]], [[capitalization]], and [[diacritic]]s (e.g. accents). In English, spelling is a problem for all learners, and is the main isssue in orthography.

Fixed spelling of English words was not done by any king or government. It was the work of the early [[printing|printer]]s. They had to decide how particular words would be spelled in their books. Gradually the number of alternative spellings began to drop. The word which is "merry" today was spelled in about 30 ways in written sources from the 9th to the 16th century.<ref name=Tom/><sup>p970</sup>

== English orthography ==
English orthography, or English spelling, is the way the 26 letters of the [[alphabet]] are used to write down the 36 (IPA) sounds of English.<ref>This is a conservative figure: there are differing views as to exactly what phonemes are and how a given language should be analyzed into phonemes.</ref> The first [[manuscript]]s in [[Old English]] were written using the [[Latin]] alphabet. It had 24 letters.<ref name=Crystal>Crystal, David 1995. ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English language''. Cambridge University Press.</ref><sup>p16</sup> 

=== Vowels ===
No alphabet fits its language exactly. One reason for this is that there are always more sounds than letters. In English there are far more [[vowel]] sounds than vowels.<ref>The reasons are historical: early alphabets did not have separate vowels: Sass B. 1988. ''The genesis of the alphabet, and its development in the 2nd millenium''. Wiesbaden</ref> The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], who were the first to use letters for vowels, decided to use only a few letters for their vowel sounds. This choice influenced all later alphabets:
:"The importance of the Greeks in the history of alphabetic writing is paramount. All the alphabets in use in Europe today stand in direct or indirect relation to the ancient Greek".<ref>Diringer, David 1968. ''The alphabet: a key to the history of mankind''. 2 vols, Hutchinson, London. vol 1, p360</ref> 

English would need about 20 vowels to represent the vowel [[phonemes]] (~sounds) in common use,<ref name=Crystal/><sup>p237</sup> and some languages do have more letters for vowels. The [[Georgian language]] has a total of 41 letters.<ref>Robinson. Andrew 1995.'' The story of writing''. Thames & Hudson, London.</ref> A shorter alphabet works by using two or three letters for a single sound, or one letter for several sounds.<ref name=Tom>McArthur, Tom 1992. ''The Oxford companion to the English language''. Oxford University Press. Vowel digraphs, p313</ref>

=== Consonants ===
The English alphabet has only three consonants which have one sound, cannot be produced by other combinations and are never silent: n, r and v.<ref>Venezky R.L. 1970. ''The structure of English orthography''. The Hague: Mouton.</ref> The English language uses 22 to 26 consonant phonemes.

=== Dialects ===
The other reason that alphabets never exactly fit languages is [[dialect]]. A spoken language varies from place to place and from time to time. This is very obvious with English, as the pronunciation is so different in different parts of the world. A written language will always be less flexible than its spoken parent. It has a different function, and is produced mechanically. It must serve everyone who speaks the language, and it does this by keeping the spelling similar from one time to another.

Therefore, all alphabets have sounds which are difficult to represent with the letters in use. And English also has other problems: sounds that can be written in different ways, and spelling which can be pronounced in different ways. This all gives rise to problems of spelling.

== British and American English ==
Differences between [[American English]] and [[British English]] spelling came about mainly as the result of one man. [[Noah Webster]] (1758–1843) wrote a ''Grammar'', a ''Spelling'' book, and finally an ''American dictionary of the English language''. In the course of this, he proposed a number of simplifications in spelling. In his dictionary, he chose ''s'' over ''c'' in words like ''defense'', he changed the ''re'' to ''er'' in words like ''center'', he dropped one of the Ls in ''traveler''. At first he kept the u in words like colour or favour but dropped it in later editions. He also changed ''tongue'' to ''tung'': that did not stick. His main reason was to help children learn to read and write. Webster's dictionary contained seventy thousand words, of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before. 

Webster did create a slightly different identity for American English. But, because his efforts left the most glaring problems untackled, his variations make little difference to the way the language is used. An example of the real problems in English orthography is the word ending ''-ough'', which is pronounced several different ways: tough, bough, cough... The root causes of spelling variation are historical, and loan words come with their own (foreign) spelling. Either all French loan words should be left as they were, or they all should be changed. Either we should move wholesale to a more phonetic spelling, or not. This was proposed by many people since Webster, such as [[George Bernard Shaw]], who proposed a new [[phonetics|phonetic]] [[alphabet]] for English. In some cases Webster's changes have been widely adopted in Britain: the spelling ''programme'' came from the French; US ''program'' is clearly simpler, and more consistent with word endings in English. In our modern world, English orthography is still a problem. In some countries (notably, France) a national committee can give advice and direction as to spelling. English has long escaped from national [[custody]]. 

* Spelling, though important, is less important than how the language is used in practice. The differences between British and American English in use are more to do with [[idiom]], [[slang]] and [[vocabulary]] than they are to do with spelling. In this respect, spelling in writing or print is a bit like [[pronunciation]] in [[speech]]. They are the necessary outer clothes, but the inner substance is more important. 

* In Wikipedia (note the spelling), articles may be in either American or British English, but should be consistent within each article. More details: [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style]]

== Dictionaries and phonetics ==
Modern British spelling and use was greatly influenced by the two great English dictionaries, [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''A dictionary of the English language'' (1755), and [[James Murray]]'s ''Oxford English Dictionary''.<ref>Murray K.M.E. 1977. ''Caught in the web of words: James Murray and the Oxford English Dictionary''. ISBN 0-300-08919-8. Winchester, Simon 2003. ''The meaning of everything: the story of the Oxford English dictionary''. Oxford.</ref> Johnson's dictionary was hugely influential, abroad as well as at home. The dictionary was exported to America. 

:"The American adoption of the ''Dictionary'' was a momentous event not just in its history, but in the history of lexicography. For Americans in the second half of the eighteenth century, Johnson was the authority on language, and the subsequent development of American dictionaries was coloured by his fame".<ref name="Hitch">Hitchings, Henry 2005. ''Dr Johnson's Dictionary: the extraordinary story of the book that defined the world''. John Murray, London. ISBN 0-7195-6631-2 [US edition: New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, ISBN 0-374-11302-5]</ref><sup>p224</sup> 

For American lexicographers, the dictionary was impossible to ignore: 
:"America's two great nineteenth-century lexicographers, Noah Webster and [[Joseph Emerson Worcester]], argued fiercely over Johnson's legacy ... In 1789 [Webster] declared that 'Great Britain, whose children we are, and whose language we speak, should no longer be our standard; for the taste of her writers is already corrupted, and her language on the decline.' ... Where Webster found fault with Johnson, Joseph Worcester saluted him ... In 1846 he completed his ''Universal and critical dictionary of the English Language''.<ref name="Hitch"/><sup>p226</sup>

Some people argue which [[language]] is the easiest to spell. People who learn a second language tend to think that their first (native) language is the easiest. However, for the learner, programmatic languages, with well-defined rules, are easier to start with than English. The spelling of the English language is by far the most irregular of all alphabetic spellings and thus the most difficult to learn. English is, in its origin, a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]]. From its early roots as [[Anglo-Saxon]], it has borrowed words from many other languages: French (a [[Romance language]]) and [[Latin]] are the most frequent donors to English.

Languages that use [[phonetics|phonetic]] spelling are easier to learn to spell than others. With phonetic spelling the words are spelled as they are pronounced. The Italian word "orologio" for instance is pronounced oh-ro-LO-jo ("gi" always making a "j" sound.) In English, one comes across the word "knife". In "knife", the "k" is not spoken, even though in English it's more common to pronounce "K"s when they are in words.

== History of English spelling ==
One of the problems we have is that similar sounding words may be spelt quite differently. Rough and ruff; meet and meat; great and grate. Words with complicated spelling may be pronounced simply: Leicester is pronounced 'Lester'. Even what rules we do have are frequently broken. "''i'' before ''e'' except after ''c''" has over 100 exceptions.<ref name="Crystal"/><sup>p272</sup> Almost all these problems have come about for historical reasons. English has been changing for the last thousand years, and as the language changes, so parts of it get stuck with different spellings. 

Here are some of the causes of English orthography:<ref name="Crystal">Crystal, David 1995. ''The Cambridge encyclopedia of the English language''. Cambridge. p274–275</ref>

# Originally a 23-letter [[alphabet]] for the 35 or so [[phoneme]]s (sounds) of [[Old English]]. Other letters were added later.
# After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]], French [[scribe]]s introduced new spellings.
# [[Printing]]. Many of the early printers came from the continent of Europe, and brought other spelling norms to England. But, although print stabilised spelling, [[pronunciation]] continued to change. 
# Printing coincided with the ''Great Vowel Shift'' at the end of [[Middle English]] (end 14th to 15th centuries). To avoid complex details, here is what happened: over a century, the pronunciation of all the vowels changed, and is still not standard throughout Britain. In any event, the spelling of thousands of words now reflects their pronunciation in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s time.
# 16th-century scholars tried to indicate the history of a word by its spelling: the silent 'b' in 'debt' is there to reflect the [[Latin]] ''debitum''.
# More loan words added in the late 16th to early 17th century, such as ''pneumonia'', ''idiosyncrasy'', ''epitome'', ''cocoa''.

English has a huge number of words, but its spelling comes from many different sources. "The large and varied lexicon of English has been bought at the expense of an increasingly deversified graphology".<ref name="Crystal"/><sup>p275</sup>

== Differences between languages ==
Some languages have a high correspondence between phonemes and letters. That means they get close to one letter for each sound. If there was a perfect correspondence, that language would have ''phonemic orthography''. English is highly non-phonemic. It has almost every kind of deviation known:
#different letters for the same sound
#two or more letters for a single sound
#sound depends on nearby letters
#vast range of words whose sound varies according to dialect
#huge number of loan words with imported spellings
#defective: it does not represent some important differences in phonemes. Example: the difference between the voiced th (''the'') and the unvoiced th (''thin'').

This field of study is called "orthographic depth". The orthographic depth of an [[alphabet]]ic script is the degree to which a written language deviates from simple one-to-one [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]–[[phoneme]] correspondence.<ref>Katz L. & Frost R. 1992. The reading process is different for different orthographies: the orthographic depth hypothesis. In Frost R. & Katz L. (eds) ''Orthography, phonology, morphology, and meaning''. Advances in psychology '''94''', 67-84. Amsterdam: Elsevier North Holland Press.</ref> It shows how easy it is to predict the pronunciation of a word from its spelling. Shallow orthographies are easy to pronounce based on the written word, and deep orthographies are difficult to pronounce based on how they are written. In shallow orthographies, the spelling-sound correspondence is direct: given the rules of pronunciation, one is able to "say" the word correctly.<ref>Besner D. & Smith M.C. 1992. Basic processes in reading: is the orthographic depth hypothesis sinking? In R. Frost & L. Katz (eds) ''Orthography, phonology, morphology and meaning''. Advances in psychology '''94''', 45-66. Amsterdam: Elsevier North Holland Press. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=1993-97079-003]</ref>

Most other international languages have similar problems: in [[French language|French]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], new readers have difficulty learning to decode words. As a result, children learn to read more slowly.<ref name="goswami">
Goswami, Usha 2005. Chapter 28: Orthography, phonology, and reading development: a cross-linguistic perspective. In Malatesha, Joshi. ''Handbook of orthography and literacy''. Lawrence Erlbaum, pp. 463–464. ISBN 0-8058-4652-2</ref> In both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] there is a more direct connection between spelling and pronunciation. Those are languages with low orthographic depth.

[[File:Mobil 1 motor oil.jpg|thumb|right|Synthetic motor oil]]
The word '''oil''' is used for many different kinds of [[liquid]]s. Oil usually does not mix with water.

Some oils are made from [[plant]]s and used in [[food]]s and for [[cooking]]. Some kinds of plant oils that people use are [[African oil palm]], [[maize]] (''corn''), [[Olive (fruit)|olive]], [[peanut]], [[soy bean|soy]], and [[sunflower]].

Other kinds of oil are made from [[petroleum|crude oil]] (''petroleum'') which comes from under the ground. People use large [[oil well]]s to bring the oil up to the surface. The oil is sent in special [[ship]]s called [[tanker]]s or in [[pipeline]]s to [[factory|factories]] called [[oil refinery|refineries]] where it is distilled into [[LPG]], [[gasoline]] (''petrol''), [[diesel fuel]], and fuel oil. [[Plastic]]s are also normally made from crude oil. Oils from crude oil are also used as [[fuel]]s for [[engine]]s or as [[lubricant]]s to make the parts of machines work together without sticking or stopping.

Different kinds of oils are also used for many other things, for example to make [[cosmetics]], [[medicine]]s, [[paint]]s, and [[detergent]]s, like washing up liquids. Soap(s) are similar to detergents, but they are generally made from animal fat(s) rather than oils.

There is also [[synthetic]] oil.

[[Category:Hydrocarbons]]'''OK''' (okay) is a word in the [[English language|English]] language. It is used to mean that something is good or correct.

It can often be used instead of the word [[Yes]].  It is not certain where the word "OK" originally comes from, but some experts say it came from a funny way of writing "Ol Korrect" (All correct). 

It is also the two-letter abbreviation for the [[state]] of [[Oklahoma]] in the [[United States|United States of America]].

You also find the phrase "Ola kala" in [[Greek language|Greek]], which means something like "Everything fine".

==Background==
The term appears to have achieved prominence in the United States in 1840, when supporters of the American Democratic political party claimed during the 1840 United States presidential election that it stood for "Old Kinderhook," a nickname for a Democratic presidential candidate, [[Martin Van Buren]], a native of Kinderhook, New York. "'Vote for OK' was snappier than using his Dutch name."<ref>[[The Economist]], 2002.10.24, "Allen Read, obituary"</ref>  In response, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] opponents attributed ''OK'', in the sense of "Oll Korrect," to [[Andrew Jackson]]'s bad spelling. The country-wide publicity surrounding the election appears to have been a critical event in ''okay'''s history, widely and suddenly popularizing it across the United States.

[[Category:Words]]An '''oxymoron'''  is a term for a [[figure of speech]].<ref>[http://rhetoric.byu.edu "Oxymoron" at Rhetoric.byu.edu]; retrieved 2012-1-14.</ref>   It is made up of two or more [[word]]s that seem to be opposite to each other, or actually are opposite.

For example, the words "Wise fool", "Warm freezer", "Legal murder" all have two words. In each one, the one word looks like the opposite of the other word.

You can have words that look opposite, but are right. For example, a "warm freezer" could be right. A freezer could be warm if it was turned off or left open.

The word oxymoron is an oxymoron; 'oxy' comes from the Greek word that means 'sharp', while 'moron' comes from the [[Greek Language|Greek]] word that means 'dull'.

Words that really are opposite to each other, would be words that just cannot be put together. For example, a "round square" could not happen because squares are not round.

Oxymorons sometimes appear in [[joke]]s. Sometimes, the joke is just to say that a pair of words are an oxymoron. For example, a joke that says that "honest politician" is an oxymoron. This means that politicians are dishonest, if the word 'politician' is opposite to 'honest'.

An '''operating system''' (or '''OS''') is the name for a group of [[computer program]]s, [[device driver]]s, [[kernel]], and other things that let a [[user]] work with a [[computer]]. It can be small (like [[MenuetOS]]), or big (like [[Microsoft Windows]]). Different operating systems can be used for different reasons. Some are used for every day things like on a [[PC|personal computer]]. Others are used for [[specialize]]d work.

An operating system has many jobs. It is responsible for making sure that all the programs can use the [[CPU]], system [[RAM|memory]], [[display]]s, [[input]] [[device]]s, and other [[hardware]]. It also lets the user have a fast, clean, and safe [[interface]] so they can do work on the computer. It also talks to other computers or devices on a [[network]].

==History==

The first operating system was used with the [[ENIAC]] (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer).<ref name="pkrz_rutgers">{{cite web|last=Krzyzanowski|first=Paul|title=Operating Systems|url=https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/416/notes/01-intro.html|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref> It was very hard to make ENIAC do work. How the operating system worked was based on how the [[switch]]es and [[cable]]s were put together and depending on this factor [[punch card]]s would make a [[result]]. While this was an operating system of a kind, it is not what is thought of as one in modern times.

[[File:Using a DEC VT-100 UNIX Terminal.webm|thumb|right|Video: Using an old UNIX system.]]

The first operating system that looked and felt like operating systems in the modern age was [[UNIX]], made in 1969 by [[Bell Labs]]. It had a small kernel and many tiny programs that could be put together to work with user [[input]] and [[data]]. Many of its [[feature]]s were taken from [[Multics]], an older operating system made in 1964.<ref name="pkrz_rutgers" />

'''Philosophy''' is a way of thinking about the [[world]], the [[universe]], and [[society]]. It works by asking very basic questions about the nature of human thought, the nature of the universe, and the connections between them. The ideas in philosophy are often general and ''[[wikt:abstract|abstract]]''. But this does not mean that philosophy is not about the real world. [[Ethics]], for example, asks what are the ideas underlying our everyday lives. [[Metaphysics]] asks about how the world works and of what it is made.

Sometimes people talk about how they have a "personal philosophy", which means the way a person thinks about the world. This article is ''not'' about people's "personal philosophies". This article is about the ideas that have discussed by [[philosopher]]s (people who think and write about ways of thinking) for a long time. 

One philosophical question is this: "Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it?".<ref>[[Bertrand Russell|Russell, Bertrand]] 1912. ''The problems of philosophy''. Home University Library.</ref> Other questions asked by philosophers are these: 

* What is [[Goodness|good]]?
* What is [[beauty]]?
* Do we have [[free will]]?
* Does [[God]] exist?
* Does the [[world]] around us [[existence|exist]]?
* What is a [[person]]?
* What is [[truth]]? 
* What is [[evil]]?
* What is the [[relationship]] between [[mind]] and [[body]]?
* What is [[science]]? 
* What is [[philosophy]]?
* What is [[love]]?

== History ==
The word "philosophy" comes from two [[Greek language|Greek]] words, meaning "love of wisdom". φίλος adj. "beloved" + σοφία fem. noun "[[wisdom]]".

There are different types of philosophy from different times and places. Some philosophers came from [[Ancient Greece]], such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. Others came from Asia, such as [[Confucius]] or [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. Some philosophers are from the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, such as [[William of Ockham]] or [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]]. 

Philosophers from the 1600s, 1700s, and 1800s included [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[René Descartes]], [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]. Philosophers from the 1900s included [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].

== Areas of inquiry ==
'''Philosophy''' is the study of [[human]]s and the [[world]] by thinking and asking questions. It is a science and an [[art]]. Philosophy tries to answer important questions by coming up with answers about real things and asking "why?"

Sometimes, philosophy tries to answer the same questions as [[religion]] and [[science]]. Philosophers do not all give the same answers to questions. Some people think there are no right answers in philosophy, only better answers and worse answers. Many types of philosophy criticize or even attack the beliefs of science and religion. 

In his work ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'',  [[Immanuel Kant]] asked the following questions:<ref>Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, II 2 2</ref>
#What can I say? 
#What shall I do?
#What dare I hope?
#What is man?
The answers to these questions gives the different domains or categories of philosophy.

=== Categories in philosophy ===
Philosophy can be divided into different groups, based on the types of questions that it asks. Below is a list of questions split into groups. One possible list of answers to these questions can be called a 'philosophy'. There are many different 'philosophies', because all of these questions have many different answers according to different people. Not all philosophies ask the same questions. These are the questions that are usually asked by philosophers from the [[Western world]]:

'''[[Metaphysics]]''':

Metaphysics is sometimes split up into [[ontology]] (the philosophy of real life and living things), the [[philosophy of mind]] and the [[philosophy of religion]]; but these sub-branches are very close together.

''Ontology'':
* What is the world that we see around us? (What is [[reality]]?)
** Is there more to the world than just what we see or hear? 
** If nobody sees something happening, does that mean that it did not happen?
** What does it mean to say that something is possible? Do other worlds exist?
* Is there anything very special about being a [[human being]] or being [[life|alive]] at all?
** If not, why do some people think that there is?
* What is [[Space (physics)|space]]? What is [[time]]?

''The philosophy of mind'':
* What is a [[mind]]?
* What is a [[body]]?
* What is [[consciousness]]?
* Do people make choices, or can they only choose to do one thing? (Do people have [[free will]]?)
* What makes words or ideas meaningful? (What is the relation between meaningful words or ideas and the things that they mean?)

''The philosophy of religion'':
* Do people have [[soul]]s?
* Is there a [[God]] who created the Universe?

'''In [[epistemology]]''':

* What is [[knowledge]]? 
* How can we know anything?
* What is [[science]]?
* What is [[truth]]?

'''In [[ethics]]''':
* What are right and wrong, good and bad?
* Should people do some things and not others?
* What is [[:wikt:justice|justice]]?

'''In [[aesthetics]]''':
* What is [[beauty]]? What if one person thinks a painting is beautiful, but another person thinks the painting is ugly? Can the painting be beautiful and ugly at the same time?
* Are [[truth|true]] things beautiful?
* Are [[goodness|good]] things beautiful?
* What is [[art]]? We commonly think that a [[sculpture]] in a [[museum]] is art. If a sculptor sculpts a sculpture of a rock from clay, and puts it in a museum, many would call it art. But what if a person picks up a rock from the ground - is the rock a piece of art?

'''In [[logic]]''':
* What do the words we use mean?
* How can we say things (especially [[idea]]s) in a way that only has one meaning?
* Can all ideas be expressed using [[language]]?
* How does the [[truth]] of an [[argument]]'s [[premise]] affect the truth of its conclusion?
* How can we reason correctly? 

'''In [[axiology]]''':
* What has value?
* Is time really money? or have we made it so?
* Does love, beauty, or justice hold any value?

Other divisions include [[eschatology]], [[teleology]] and [[theology]]. In past centuries natural [[science]] was included in philosophy, and called "natural philosophy".

== Is philosophy good or bad? ==
Does philosophy do any good? Very few people would dispute this. It is easy to argue that philosophy is a good thing, because it helps people to think more clearly. Philosophy helps people to understand the world and the way people act and think. Philosophers believe that asking philosophical questions is useful because it brings [[wisdom]] and helps people to learn about the world and each other. Some philosophers might even argue that the question "Is philosophy good or bad?" is a philosophical question itself.

However, some people think that philosophy is harmful, as philosophy encourages free-thinking and often questions the beliefs that others hold. For example, philosophies such as some [[existentialist]] views say that there is no meaning to life or human existence, except the meaning that we make up or invent. People from some religions do not agree with the beliefs of existentialism.

It should be noted that every major science, including physics, biology, and chemistry are all disciplines that originally were considered philosophy. As speculation and analysis about nature became more developed, these subjects branched away. This is a process that continues even today; psychology only split in the past century. In our own time, subjects such as consciousness studies, decision theory, and applied ethics have increasingly found independence from philosophy as a whole. Because of this, philosophy seems useful because it makes new kinds of science.

== What philosophers do ==
Philosophers ask questions about ideas ([[concepts]]). They try to find answers to those questions. Some thinkers find it very hard to find those words that best describe the ideas they have. When they find answers to some of these questions philosophers often have the same problem, that is how to best tell the answers they found to other people. Depending on the meaning of the words they use, the answers change. 

Some philosophers are full-time thinkers (called academics), who work for universities or colleges. These philosophers write books and articles about philosophy and teach classes about philosophy to university or college students.

Other philosophers are just "[[hobby]]" thinkers who think about philosophy during their free time. A small number of hobby thinkers have thought so much about philosophy that they are able to write articles for philosophy magazines. Other people approach philosophy from another job. For example [[monk]]s, [[artist]]s, and [[scientist]]s may think about philosophical ideas and questions.

Most philosophers work by asking questions and looking for good definitions (meanings) of words to help them understand what a question means.

Some philosophers say the only thing needed to answer a question is to find out what it means, and that the only thing that makes philosophical questions such as those above difficult is that people do not really know what they mean (for example [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]).

Philosophers will also often use both real and imaginary examples to make a point. For example, they may write about a real or fictional person in order to show what they think a good person or a bad person is like.

Some philosophers look for the simplest way to answer a question and say that is probably the right answer. This is a process called [[Occam's razor]]. Others believe that complicated answers to questions can also be right. For an example of a philosophical problem, see the [[God paradox]].

Philosophers use [[logic]] to solve problems and answer questions. Logical [[consistency]] is a cornerstone of any acceptable theory. Philosophers who disagree with a theory will often try to find a logical  [[contradiction]] within the theory. If they can find one, this gives them a reason to reject that theory. If they cannot find any inconsistency, the philosopher might try to show that the theory leads to a conclusion which is either unacceptable or ridiculous. This second approach is usually called [[reductio ad absurdum]].

'''Physics''', a branch of [[science]], is the study of how the [[universe]] works. The word ''Physics'' comes from [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] (''ta physika''), meaning "the natural things."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=physics&allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|first=|last=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}</ref>

Physics is one of the oldest sciences. Since physics tries to describe the entire universe, there is a lot of overlap between different fields of study like [[biology]] or [[chemistry]].

Physics is also useful for creating new [[technology]]. For example, the radio was only possible because physics gave us a better understanding of how [[electromagnetic radiation]] works.

== History ==

=== Ancient astronomy ===
[[Astronomy]] is the oldest [[natural science]]. The Sumerians, Ancient Egyptians, and Indus Valley Civilization all understood how the [[Astronomical object|things in the sky]] moved since before 3000 BCE. They believed the stars and planets represented their gods, so they kept track of them very well.

A lot of astronomy comes from [[Mesopotamia]], [[Babylonia]], [[Ancient Egypt]], and [[Ancient Greece]]. Most names for constellations come from Greek astronomers.

=== Natural philosophy ===
Natural philosophy started in Greece around 650 BCE when [[Pre-socratic philosophers|some philosophers]] rejected [[superstition]] and decided [[Naturalism (philosophy)|things had to happen for a reason]]. [[Leucippus]] and his student Democritus suggested the idea of the [[atom]] around this period.

=== Physics in the medieval Islamic world ===
[[Science in medieval Islam|Islamic scholars]] continued to study [[Aristotelian physics]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. They also developed an early form of the [[scientific method]].

Scientists like [[Ibn Sahl]], [[Al-Kindi]], [[Ibn al-Haytham]], [[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī|Al-Farisi]] and [[Avicenna]] worked a lot on [[optics]] and [[vision]]. In ''[[Book of Optics|The Book of Optics]]'', [[Ibn al-Haytham|Ibn Al-Haitham]] rejects previous Greek ideas and comes up with a new theory about vision. The book was the first one that studied [[Pinhole camera|pinhole cameras]], and explained how the eye works. Ibn Al-Haytham also built the first [[camera obscura]] hundreds of years before [[photography]] was invented.

''The Book of Optics'' affected the way people thought about optics for more than 600 years. It's as influential as Isaac Newton's book by the same name. Thanks to this book, things like [[eyeglasses]], [[Telescope|telescopes]], [[Camera|cameras]], and [[Magnifying glass|magnifying glasses]] were invented.

=== Classical physics ===
Physics became a separate field of study after the [[Scientific revolution|Scientific Revolution]].

[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo Galilei's]] experiments helped to create classical physics. He invented the telescope, and then saw that the stars and planets were not perfect. He also (supposedly) dropped some cannonballs from the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa|tower of Pisa]] and noticed that they hit the ground at the same time, despite one being heavier than the other. Galileo also realized that an object dropped straight down hits the ground at the same time as an object falling and going sideways. This meant that an object in uniform motion (moving in a straight line) is the same as an object that is still, depending on how you look at it.

[[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton]] used Galileo's ideas to put together his [[Newton's laws of motion|three laws of motion]]. He then used those laws to prove that they worked for objects on earth and in outer space. Newton hoped that classical mechanics could explain everything, including light (it couldn't).

Newton ran out of math to do physics, so he invented some more math and called it [[calculus]]. However, at the same time [[Gottfried Leibniz]] also invented calculus and introduced the notation that's used today. Classical mechanics still uses Newton's notation though.

[[Leonhard Euler]] added his [[Euler's laws of motion|own laws of motion]] that worked for rigid bodies (things that don't bend or flop) and not just points. These deal with [[torque]] and [[angular momentum]].

Then [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Joseph Louis Lagrange]] changed Newtonian mechanics in 1788 to solve more problems. [[Lagrangian mechanics]] is used to find the path of a particle that does the least amount of work.

[[William Rowan Hamilton]] then changed [[Lagrangian mechanics]] in 1833 to solve even more problems. [[Hamiltonian mechanics]] made physics more abstract to understand it better, and it eventually led to the development of [[statistical mechanics]] and [[quantum mechanics]].

=== Modern Physics ===
As research progressed, scientists found things, very big and very small, that classical mechanics couldn't explain.

Classical mechanics predicted that the [[speed of light]] varied, but [[Maxwell's equations]] said the speed of light stayed the same. Eventually [[Albert Einstein]] fixed the problem by coming up with his theory of [[special relativity]]. Relativity applies when something is very big, moving very fast, or both.

[[Max Planck]] came up with [[quantum mechanics]] to explain why [[Photoelectric effect|metal releases electrons when you shine a light at it]], and why [[Black-body radiation|stuff just emits radiation]]. Quantum mechanics applies for very small things like the electrons, protons, and neutrons that make up an atom.

People like [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]], and [[Paul Dirac]] continued to work on quantum mechanics and eventually we got the [[Standard Model]].

Today physicists are working on getting relativity and quantum mechanics to work together by creating a [[Grand Unified Theory]], or GUT. A GUT would explain everything in the universe.

== Definition ==

Physics is the study of [[energy]] and [[matter]] in [[Space (physics)|space]] and [[time]] and how they are related to each other. Physicists assume the existence of [[mass]], [[length]], [[time]] and [[electric current]] and then define (give the meaning of) all other [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] in terms of these [[units of measurement|basic units]]. Mass, length, time, and electric current are never defined but the [[standard]] units used to measure them are always defined. In the [[International System of Units]] (abbreviated SI from the French '''S'''ystème '''I'''nternational), the [[kilogram]] is the basic unit of mass, the [[metre]] is the basic unit of length, the [[second]] is the basic unit of time, and the [[ampere]] is the basic unit of electric current.

In addition to these four units, there are three other ones: the [[Mole (unit)|mole]], which is the unit of the quantity of matter, the [[candela]] which measures the luminous intensity (the power of lighting) and the [[kelvin]], the unit of temperature.

Physics studies how things move, and the [[Force (physics)|forces]] that make them move. For example, [[velocity]] and [[acceleration]] are used by physics to show how things move. Also, [[physicists]] study the [[Force (physics)|forces]] of [[gravity]], [[electricity]], [[magnetism]] and the forces that hold things together. 

Physics studies very large things, and very small things. For instance, physicists can study [[star]]s, [[planet]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]] but could also study small pieces of matter, such as [[atom]]s and [[electron]]s.They may also study [[sound]], [[light]] and other [[wave]]s. As well as that, they could examine [[energy]], [[heat]] and [[radioactivity]], and even [[Space (physics)|space]] and [[time]]. 
Physics not only helps people understand how objects move, but how they change form, how they make [[noise]], how [[heat|hot]] or [[cold]] they will be, and what they are made of at the [[atom|smallest level]].

== Physics and Mathematics==

Physics is a [[quantity|quantitative]] science because it is based on [[measure|measuring]] with [[number]]s. [[Mathematics]] is used in physics to make [[model]]s that try to [[prediction|guess]] what will happen in [[nature]]. The guesses are compared to the way the [[real]] [[world]] works. [[Physicist]]s are always working to make their models of the world better.

== Advanced knowledge ==
=== General description ===
Physics is the [[science]] of [[matter]] and how [[matter]] interacts. [[Matter]] is any physical material in the [[universe]]. Everything is made of [[matter]]. Physics is used to describe the physical universe around us, and to predict how it will behave. 
Physics is the [[science]] concerned with the discovery and characterization of the universal laws which govern [[matter]], [[movement]] and [[Force (physics)|forces]], and [[Space (physics)|space]] and [[time]], and other features of the natural world.

=== Breadth and goals of physics ===
The sweep of physics is broad, from the smallest components of matter and the forces that hold it together, to [[galaxy|galaxies]] and even larger things. There are only four [[force]]s that appear to operate over this whole range. However, even these four [[force]]s ([[gravity]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[weak force]] associated with radioactivity, and the [[strong force]] which holds [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] in an [[atom]] together) are believed to be different parts of a single force. 

Physics is mainly focused on the goal of making ever simpler, more general, and more accurate rules that define the character and behavior of matter and space itself. 
One of the major goals of physics is making theories that apply to everything in the universe. In other words, physics can be viewed as the study of those universal laws which define, at the most basic level possible, the behavior of the physical [[universe]].

=== Physics uses the scientific method ===
Physics uses the [[scientific method]]. That is, data from experiments and observations are [[:wikt:collect|collected]]. Theories which attempt to explain these data are produced. Physics uses these theories to not only describe physical phenomena, but to model physical systems and predict how these physical systems will behave. Physicists then compare these predictions to observations or experimental evidence to show whether the theory is right or wrong.

The theories that are well supported by data and are especially simple and general are sometimes called [[scientific law]]s. Of course, all theories, including those known as laws, can be replaced by more accurate and more general laws, when a disagreement with data is found.<ref>An equation (e.g., f = m a) is called a "law" when there are clear empirical results that substantiate it.</ref>

=== Physics is quantitative ===
Physics is more quantitative than most other sciences. That is, many of the observations in physics may be represented in the form of numerical measurements. Most of the theories in physics use mathematics to express their principles. Most of the predictions from these theories are numerical. This is because of the areas which physics has addressed work better with quantitative approaches than other areas. Sciences also tend to become more quantitative with time as they become more highly developed, and physics is one of the oldest sciences.

=== Fields of physics ===

[[Classical physics]] normally includes the fields of [[mechanics]], [[optics]], [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], [[acoustics]] and [[thermodynamics]]. Modern physics is a term normally used to cover fields which rely on quantum theory, including [[quantum mechanics]], atomic physics, [[nuclear physics]], [[particle physics]] and [[condensed matter physics]], as well as the more modern fields of [[general relativity|general]] and [[special relativity]]. Although this difference can be found in older writings, it is of little new interest as quantum effects are now understood to be of importance even in fields that before were called classical.<ref>Different people, however, have different definitions of what they regard physics to be, and another common definition is that, "''physics is the science of [[nature]]''" [1,2,3,4,5,6].</ref>

=== Approaches in physics ===
There are many approaches to studying physics, and many different kinds of activities in physics. There are two main types of activities in physics; the collection of data and the development of theories. 

The data in some subfields of physics is amenable to experiment. For example, condensed matter physics and nuclear physics benefit from the ability to perform experiments. Experimental physics focuses mainly on an [[Empiricism|empirical]] approach. Sometimes experiments are done to explore nature, and in other cases experiments are performed to produce data to compare with the predictions of theories. 

Some other fields in physics like astrophysics and geophysics are mostly observational sciences because most of their data has to be collected passively instead of through experimentation. However, observational programs in these fields use many of the same tools and technology that are used in the experimental subfields of physics. 
 
Theoretical physics often uses quantitative approaches to develop the theories that attempt to explain the data. In this way, theoretical physics often use tools from [[mathematics]]. Theoretical physics often can involve creating quantitative predictions of physical theories, and comparing these predictions quantitatively with data. Theoretical physics sometimes creates models of physical systems before data is available to test and support these models. There are many important uses of physics like measuring houses or any measure. Also, it can be used to measure falling objects like planes. 

These two main activities in physics, data collection and theory production and testing, use many different skills. This has led to a lot of specialization in physics, and the introduction, development and use of tools from other fields. For example, theoretical physicists use mathematics and numerical analysis and statistics and probability and computer software in their work. Experimental physicists develop instruments and techniques for collecting data, using engineering and computer technology and many other fields of technology. Often the tools from these other areas are not quite appropriate for the needs of physics, and need to be changed or more advanced versions have to be made.

== Physicists ==
There are many famous physicists. [[Isaac Newton]] studied gravity. [[Galileo Galilei]] studied [[light]] and how planets moved. [[Albert Einstein]] made a [[theory]] for how light can make [[electron]]s move, and studied how gravity affects light and space. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] proved that light is a type of [[electromagnetic wave]].

[[Category:Physics| ]]'''Politics''' is the way that people living in groups make decisions. 
Politics is about making agreements between people so that they can live together in groups such as [[tribe]]s, [[city|cities]], or [[country|countries]]. In large groups, such as countries, some people may spend a lot of their time making such agreements. These people are called [[politician]]s. Politicians, and sometimes other people, may get together to form a [[government]]. The study of politics in universities is called [[political science]], political studies, or [[public administration]].

In everyday life, the term "politics" refers to the way that countries are governed, and to the ways that governments make rules and laws. But politics can also be seen in other groups, too, such as in big companies, schools and churches.

== Governments ==
The government <!--makes decisions for--> tries to lead the whole group. Governments do things such as:
* Decide which people get which pieces of [[land]]
* Decide which people can tell other people what to do
* Decide whether to go to [[war]] with another country
* Create [[money]]
* Build things for the use of the whole group, such as [[road]]s, [[hospital]]s, [[library|libraries]], and [[dock]]s.
* [[education|Educate]] people, either for their own good, or to teach them what the government wants them to know
* Take care of the very young, the sick, or the very [[old]]
* Manage the [[welfare]] of the country and manages the money available for spending on services ([[Hospital]]s, [[School]]s, etc.)

One of the ways the government leads the group is by making [[law]]s and rules which tell everybody what they can and can not do. The government makes these laws so that society will be safe and well-ordered. The law that "you must not drink alcohol while driving a car" stops people from [[drunk driving]], which could kill people. The law "you must wear a helmet on a motorcycle" makes sure that people protect themselves.

The government can also control people and what happens in a country in other ways besides making laws.
* For example, how the government spends its money makes a big difference in what people will do or what will happen to people. If the government spends a lot of money on hospitals and nurses, the people will probably become healthier.
* Also, if people like their government, or think that their government is wise, they may do something just because their government says it is a good thing to do. Governments often make posters or television advertisements that encourage people to stop smoking cigarettes or eat more fruits and vegetables.

Politics is often compared to [[ethics]] (ideas about right and wrong). Ethics is a more [[abstract]] study of right and wrong. Ethics is usually more [[concern]]ed with [[principle]] than law or politics or diplomacy, so many people think ethics is not [[practical]]. But without some [[agreement]] on ethics, there is probably no way to even have a [[debate]], [[law]]s or an [[election]]. There is always some agreement on ethics and [[personal conduct]] in a [[political system]].

== Political parties ==
In most countries, people have formed [[political parties]] to put forward their ideas. There is usually some disagreement between people within a party, but they work together because they feel that they agree on enough things, and they will have more power if they join together. They agree to take the same [[position]] on many [[Issue (debate)|issues]], and agree to support the same changes to [[law]] and the same [[leader]]s. An election is usually a competition between different parties.

== History ==
The Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] wrote that humans are a political animal and that [[ethics]] and politics are closely linked.
	
[[Niccolo Machiavelli]] wrote that politics was firstly about having and keeping [[Influence|power]]. He said that without power, a leader could do nothing.

In 1651, [[Thomas Hobbes]] wrote ''[[Leviathan (book)|Leviathan]]'', a book about politics. Hobbes wrote that people living in groups often give up some of their rights in exchange for some protections from a government.
	
In the 1800s, [[John Stuart Mill]] developed the "liberal" idea of politics. Mill said that democracy is the most important political development of the 1800s. He said that there should be more protection for individual rights against the government. [[Bernard Crick]] wrote a list of the [[political virtues]], which were about [[best practice]]s of politics itself.

== International politics ==
There are also disagreements between different countries. Attempts to solve the problem with meetings are called [[diplomacy]]. This is politics between [[nation]]s instead of politics within nations. If the problems are not resolved by diplomatic meetings they can lead to [[war]] or [[terrorism]].

[[Category:Politics| ]]{{redirect|principle|occupation|Principal}}

A '''value''' (or '''principle''') usually means an [[abstract]] [[rule]], one that can be seen to apply in many [[experience]]s, or can be [[apply|applied]] by choice in a lot of [[situation]]s. It can also mean a [[moral]] choice one makes often and [[consistent]]ly, for example, some [[Buddhist]]s avoid eating meat as a matter of principle.

Many groups of people agree on lists of principles. They may also try to agree on the order in which they are to apply, that is, which principles should be violated before which other ones. They might also try to list best practices which reflect the principles in the right order, and provide more practical (less abstract) [[:wikt:instruction|instruction]].

[[Category:Culture]][[Image:Profanity.svg|alt=Cartoon drawing|thumb|right|A drawing of profanity replaced by symbols]]

'''Profanity''' is the act of using '''swear words'''.  The [[adjective]] is 'profane'. Profanities can also be called curse ("cuss") words, dirty words, bad words, foul language, obscenity, obscene language, or expletives. It can be called an oath, although this word also has a normal meaning of a "solemn promise".  

Religious profanity is called [[blasphemy]].  The [[verb]] is to blaspheme and the [[adjective]] is 'blasphemous'. Saying “God!” or “Jesus Christ!” as an expression of surprise or annoyance is considered by many people to be blasphemy, mostly because one of the [[Ten Commandments]] says not to use God's name "in vain" (without substance or without relevance). Swearing oaths can also be considered wrong by some who follow Jesus' teaching against swearing oaths in the [[Gospel]]s (such as Matthew 5:34).

A profanity usually refers to [[religion]], [[sex]], or bodily functions. These are things that people feel very strongly about. In some languages, such as [[French language|French]], there is more profanity about religion than most other topics.

A profanity can be a word or [[gesture]] or some other form of behaviour.<ref>"[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/profane Definition of Profane]", emphasis on original, Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, retrieved on June 5, 2007.</ref>
 
Different words can be profanity to different people, and what words are thought of as profanity in English can change over time.

Whether a word is a profanity will always depend on the way people think. Some people will be offended by something, while others will not be. Words which should not be used are [[taboo]] words. Using such words is thought by some people to be a [[sin]]. For example, some [[Christianity|Christians]], some [[Islam|Muslims]] and many [[Mormons]] believe that swearing is a sin.

== Opinions on profanity ==
Some people call profanity "crude," but some say that it is no cruder to say "damn" or "crap" than it is to use "hate" (a word that simply creates a very strong [[Emotions|emotion]], but not a swear word). People who use profanity do not always mean to make anybody feel bad, and tolerance for different forms of profanity can vary widely, from person to person. Most often, using profanity is a verbal outlet for strong feelings (usually unpleasant ones), that might otherwise cause a physical reaction. At other times, some people may use profanity as [[humor]].

== Coprolalia ==
Some people develop a mental condition where they use profanity constantly. This is called [[coprolalia]]. Many people think this is called Tourette syndrome. Tourette syndrome is actually a group of [[symptom|symptoms]] that only includes coprolalia 15% of the time. The condition can be {{broken wikt link|aggravate|aggravated}} (made worse) by stress.

== Examples of profanity ==
Several of these words come from [[Anglo-Saxon]] or [[Norse]] names for body parts, and bodily functions.  They came to be thought of as profanity mostly after the [[Normandy|Norman]]s brought [[French language|French]] and [[Latin]] words for them to England.  

;Cocksucker
:Sex as someone who sucks the penis, this word is considered to be very disgusting and used to describe a disgusting person.

;Cunt
:A [[vagina]]. Also an offensive term for a disliked woman ("She's a real cunt") or "cuntface" or stupid "cunt".

;Dick
:A vulgar term for a [[penis]] similar to the term 'prick.'

;Fuck
:A [[verb]], meaning to have [[sex]]. Can also mean to cheat or steal from ("fuck over") someone, to interfere with ("fuck with") something or someone, or to cause harm ("fuck up"). "Fuck up" can also mean to make a mistake. It is often used as a meaningless intensifier, especially in the adverb form ("too fucking expensive"), ("What the fuck?"). Fuck is also used to describe someone under the influence of drugs and or alcohol ("they're fucked up"). A person may also be referred to as a fuck.  The many uses for fuck make it one of the most versatile words in the English language. For example, "That fuck Jonathan was so fucked up last night he fucked some fucking whore and got fucking [[gonorrhea]]. Holy fuck!"
'''Honky'''

An offensive word for [[white people]], commonly used in the [[United States]], first used refer to whites around 1946
;Motherfucker
:An insult that can be used for [[:en:Incest|sex inside the family]], but mostly used in the sense of ''bastard''. The verb ''motherfucking'' is used mainly in [[rap music]] as a stronger form of ''fucking''. (see above)

;Nigger
:An offensive word for [[African American|black people]]. "Nigger" (or "nigga") is commonly used in popular urban black [[rap music|rap]] media, where it is used towards others in friendly or [[derogatory]] manner.

;Poon
:An offensive term for woman that is very similar to cunt or pussy and also refers to the [[vagina]].

;Prick
:This term refers to the [[penis]], and also as an insult for an unpleasant person.

;Pussy
:This term refers to the [[vulva]], and also to a weak man. It can also refer to the practice of stimulating a woman's vulva, [[cunnilingus]].

;Quim
:The [[vagina]] or [[vulva]]. Used similarly to "cunt".

;Shit
:[[Feces]]; also a verb, meaning to {{broken wikt link|defecate|defecate}}. As an exclamation, it is similar to "fuck". It can be used to refer to any object, although it is often used in reference to drugs ([[heroin]] or [[marijuana]] in particular), music, or a person's belongings. May also mean trouble, or annoyance by others ("I'm tired of this shit"). It can also mean very poor/of bad quality ("this music is shit").

== Profane gestures ==
These are mostly performed while facing another person, and can be meant toward them, or about them. These gestures are considered as strong as profane words in most cases.

;Biting one's thumb
:Performed by placing the tip of a thumb under the front teeth, then pulling the thumb slightly forward, with the fingers closed. Mocks the "thumbs up" gesture. Can be taken to mean "bite me", though it predates the common use of this phrase.

;Grabbing one's own crotch
:Also an invitation to "bite me", or to perform [[:wikt:oral sex|oral sex]]<nowiki/> in a {{broken wikt link|servile|servile}} way.

;Pretending to give [[fellatio]]
:One pokes out a cheek with the tongue, while rocking a closed hand toward the mouth, at the same time. Indicates something or someone is a waste of time.

;Pretending to masturbate
:Indicates something or someone is a waste of time, or performs poorly.

;Showing one's [[middle finger]] ("flipping the bird")

The '''People's Republic of China''' ('''PRC''') ({{zh|s=中华人民共和国|t=中華人民共和國}}) is a [[one-party state]] in [[East Asia]] governed by the [[Communist Party of China]]. It was founded on 1 October 1949. It has over 1.3 billion [[people]], which is more than any other country in the [[world]].<ref name="Census2010" /> It covers an area of 9.6 million [[square kilometers]]. 

The capital city is [[Beijing]], and [[Shanghai]] is the city with the most people living in it. Along with the cities of [[Tianjin]] and [[Chongqing]], these four cities are "[[municipality|municipalities]]" directly controlled by the national government. Two other cities are given the status of "special administrative regions". They are [[Hong Kong]], which was once a colony of the [[United Kingdom]] and given back to China in 1997; and [[Macau]], which [[Portugal]] gave back in 1999. These two cities remain highly autonomous.

The central government is responsible for defense and foreign affairs but not the daily operations for 50 years. PRC claims [[Taiwan]] as one of its many provinces.  However, PRC does not have control of [[Taiwan]] which has an entirely different [[political]] system and officially known as the [[Republic of China|Republic of China (Taiwan)]].

Chinese civilization was also one of the few to invent [[writing]],<ref name="Hagg">Haggett, Peter. [2001] (2001). Encyclopedia of World Geography, Volume 23. Edition 2, illustrated.

ISBN 0-521-49781-7, 9780521497817. p 40.</ref> It reached its golden age during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (c. A.D. 10th century).  Home of  [[Confucianism]] and [[Daoism]], it had great influence on nearby countries including Japan, Korea, and Vietnam in the areas of political system, philosophy, religion, art, and even writing and literature. China is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world. Statues and pottery, as well as decorations made of [[jade]], are some classic examples.

Before the [[Qin Dynasty]] united China, there were hundreds of small states that fought each other for hundreds of years in a war to control China. This is known as the [[Warring States Period]]. Although the continuing wars made people suffer, it was at this time when many great philosophies were born, including [[Confucianism]] and [[Daoism]]. Confucianism and Daoism alone have been the foundation of many social values seen in modern eastern-Asian cultures today.

Its geography mostly looked like that of modern China, except with northern and western edges that varied. It was often attacked by northern [[nomadic people]] such as the Turkics, the [[Mongol|Mongols]] lead by [[Genghis Khan]], and [[Kublai Khan]]. During the history of ancient China, the northern nomadic people and the Chinese people had been fighting each other and taking turns to rule the land and the people of China. However, when the northern people beat the Chinese people and came to rule the kingdom, they also Incorporated the Chinese way of living and became like the Chinese. Many of the strongest dynasties of China were ruled by the northern people, including the [[Qing Dynasty|Qin]], [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] (Mongolian), and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]]. Each time, they also brought new elements into the Chinese culture.

=== A new age ===
While China achieved many things in the [[First millennium]] and early [[2nd millennium]], it became an [[Isolationism|isolationist]] country in the [[15th century|15th century C.E.]] This was because Spain found enormous silver in the new continent, which was the main currency (money) in China and Europe at the time, and China did not want to be bought by the foreigners.

By the time of the [[Renaissance]], European powers started to take over other countries in Asia.  While China was never actually taken over, many [[Europe|European]] [[countries]], such as [[Britain]] and [[France]] built [[spheres of influence]] in China.  Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few [[centuries]], by the [[Qing Dynasty]], it had fallen behind other countries in [[technology]], and was helpless to stop this from happening.  This had become clear when it lost the [[Opium Wars]] to [[Britain]] in the [[19th century]].

In 1912, the Qing dynasty was overthrown by the [[Kuomintang]], a [[nationalist]] party, and the [[Republic of China]] established. Over time, [[Marxism|Marxist]] ideas grew popular and the [[Communist Party of China|Communist party]] was formed.

The [[Chinese Civil War]] later started between the [[Kuomintang]] (Nationalists) of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) and the Communists of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Communists wanted to make China like the Soviet Union, whereas the other side wanted to keep China in its current state at the time. The Communists were led by [[Mao Zedong]], [[Liu Shaoqi]] and others. Later Liu lost influence with Mao and his death to this day remains unresolved. The Communists eventually won the war. The Nationalists (led by Chiang Kai-shek) fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in Taipei. After the Chinese Civil War, the Communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country, the People's Republic of China (PRC), in Beijing on October 1, 1949.

In 1927, the [[Chinese Civil War]] began as the Kuomintang, led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]], and the Communists fought one another. By 1949, the [[Red Army]] of the Chinese Communist Party had gained control over [[mainland China]] and [[Mao Zedong]] announced the creation of the People's Republic of China. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the other nationalists fled to [[Taiwan]].[[File:China, Mao (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Mao Zedong]] founding the People's Republic of China in 1949]]

As the leader of the People's Republic of China, Mao began many social and economic reform projects with mixed results. The [[Great Leap Forward]], from 1958 to 1961, tried to [[industrialization|industrialize]] China and increase its food production, but resulted in one of the largest [[famine]]s in history. It is estimated that 45 million people died as a result of this reform project.<ref name="Akbar2010">{{Cite news|url =http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html |title= Mao's Great Leap Forward 'killed 45 million in four years'|accessdate=26 March 2013 |work=The Independent |location=London |first=Arifa|last=Akbar|date=17 September 2010}}</ref> In 1966, Mao began the [[Cultural Revolution]] to remove [[capitalism|capitalist]] influences from society and government. Major government officials and ordinary citizens were accused of being "revisionists" - people who disagreed with some parts of Marxism - or "counter-revolutionaries" and were [[persecution|persecuted]]. Many universities and schools were closed, and historical and religious sites were destroyed. Although the program officially ended in 1969, it continued until Mao's death in 1976.

During this time period, the People's Republic of China did not get along with the [[capitalist]] countries of the [[Western world]]. Beginning in the 1960s, relationships between the People's Republic of China and the [[Soviet Union]] also became increasingly unfriendly in the [[Sino-Soviet Split]]. In 1972, to counter the power of the Soviet Union, Mao and [[Zhou Enlai]] met with US President [[Richard Nixon]] in Beijing. This began to improve relationships between China and the Western world.

After Mao's death, there was a power struggle between the [[Gang of Four]] and [[Hua Guofeng]], the man Mao had chosen to be the next leader of China. Eventually, [[Deng Xiaoping]], one of the [[veteran]]s of the revolution, took power. He began a "Reform and Opening Up" ({{zh|s=改革开放|t=改革開放}}) campaign. These reforms tried to make the People's Republic of China a modern, industrial - but still socialist - nation by moving towards a [[market economy|market system]]. Deng's policies would be known as "socialism with Chinese characteristics."

Although Deng's policy helped loosen restrictions on citizens, the People's Republic of China continues to have problems with the amount of control the government has over citizens' private lives. In 1979, the [[one-child policy]], which limits most couples to one child, was created because of the [[overpopulation]] problem in the People's Republic of China. This policy is highly [[controversy|controversial]] and many Westerners have criticized it. News and Internet sites are also [[censorship|censored]] by the government.

In 1989, the Chinese government used soldiers and tanks to stop a [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|protest in Beijing's Tiananmen Square]] organized by students seeking political reform. This action received worldwide criticism and led to [[economic sanction]]s being placed on the Chinese government.

In [[August]] 2008, China hosted the [[Summer Olympics]] for the first time.

== Geography ==
{{see also|List of cities in the People's Republic of China}}
The People's Republic of China is the fourth-largest country in the world by land area after [[Russia]], [[Canada]], and [[the United States]]. It is also the largest country without any land north of the [[Arctic Circle]]. China borders 14 nations, which is more than any other country in the world. It borders [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], and [[Burma]] in Southeast Asia; [[India]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]] and [[Pakistan]]<ref name="Ref_at">China's border with Pakistan falls in the disputed [[Kashmir]] province. The area under Pakistani-administration is claimed by India.</ref> in South Asia; [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] in Central Asia; a small section of [[Altai Republic|Russian Altai]] and [[Mongolia]] in [[Inner Asia]]; and the [[Russian Far East]] and [[North Korea]] in Northeast Asia. 

China has two major rivers, the [[Yellow River]] and the [[Yangtze River]]. There is also the [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] and the [[Gobi Desert]].

The world's highest point, [[Mt. Everest]] (8848m), is on the border. The country's lowest point, and the world's fourth-lowest, is the dried lake bed of [[Ayding Lake]] (−154m). 

=== Biodiversity ===

China is one of 17 [[megadiverse countries]].<ref name="Ref_2009a">{{cite web |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/soe/2001/publications/theme-reports/biodiversity/biodiversity01-3.html |title=Biodiversity Theme Report |publisher=Environment.gov.au |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> It is in two of the world's major [[ecozone]]s: the [[Palearctic]] and the [[Indomalaya]]. In the Palearctic zone, mammals such as the horse, [[camel]], [[tapir]], and [[jerboa]] can be found. Among the species in the Indomalaya region are the [[Leopard Cat]], [[bamboo rat]], [[treeshrew]], and various [[monkey]] and [[ape]] species. Some overlap is between the two regions; [[deer]], [[antelope]], bears, [[Gray wolf|wolves]], pigs, and many rodent species can all be found in China's environments. The famous [[giant panda]] is found only in a limited area along the Yangtze River. China has a continuing problem with trade in [[endanger]]ed species. There are now laws to stop such activities.

China also has a variety of forest types. Cold [[coniferous]] forests cover most of the north of the country. The forest have animal species such as [[moose]] and the [[Asian black bear]], along with over 120 bird species. Moist [[conifer]] forests can have thickets of [[bamboo]]. It is replaced by [[rhododendron]]s in higher montane stands of [[juniper]] and [[taxus|yew]]. [[Subtropical]] forests, which are mostly in central and southern China. These support as many as 146,000 species of flora. Tropical and seasonal [[rainforest]]s, though confined to [[Yunnan]] and [[Hainan Island]], have a quarter of all the plant and animal species found in China.

== Military ==
The PRC Armed Forces, also known as the People's Liberation Army (PLA), is one of the most powerful armies in the world. Nowadays PRC is among the atomic powers in the world. It also has the largest standing army in the world of over 2 million soldiers on active duty.

== People and culture ==
There are 56 recognized minority [[ethnic group|ethnic minority groups]] in [[China]]. [[Han]] is the largest ethnic group in China (92% of the population). [[Mandarin Chinese]] is the main spoken language.

China is the origin of Eastern [[Martial art|martial arts]], called [[Kung-fu|Kung Fu]] or its first name [[Wushu]]. China is also the home of the well-respected [[Spa Monastery]] and [[Wudang Mountains]]. Martial art started more for the purpose of [[survival]], defense, and [[War|warfare]] than [[art]]. Over time some [[Art form|art forms]] have branched off, while others have retained their distinct Chinese flavor.

China has had renoned [[Artist|artists]] including [[Wong Fei Hung]] ([[Huang Fei Hung]] or [[Hwang Fei Hung]]) and many others. [[Art]] has also co-existed with a variety of [[Paint|paints]] including the more standard 18 colors. Legendary and controversial moves like [[Big Mak]] are also praised and talked about within the [[culture]].

China has many traditional [[Festival|festivals]], such as Spring Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-autumn Festival and so on. The most significant is [[Chinese New Year]]. People in China will have holidays to celebrate these festivals.

===Festivals===
Spring Festival is the Chinese New Year. It lasts fifteen days. It starts with the first day of the Chinese lunar year and ends with the full moon fifteen days later. On the first day of the Spring Festival, people call on friends and relatives. Because most of people watch the Spring Festival Celebrations on CCTV all the night on New Year's Eve and don't go to bed until 12:00 AM, they usually get up later in the next day. The fifth day of the Spring Festival is the day to welcome the god of Wealth (Chinese:财神爷), many people make and eat dumplings (Chinese:饺子). They believe that dumplings can hold the god of Wealth and bring luck.The last day of the Spring Festival is the Lantern Festival. On this day, the moon becomes the full moon. People go out and watch the lantern festivals everywhere. After that, they eat sweet dumpling (Chinese:汤圆,元宵), a kind of dumpling which is round and looks like the full moon.

Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet of the State of Chu during the [[Warring States]] period. He persuaded his emperor not to accept Qin's diplomats' offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him. He was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life. The people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse. They made and threw rice dumplings into the river. They hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poet's corpse. They also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish. Such practices, eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races, become what Chinese do in this festival nowadays.

Held on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, Mid-Autumn Festival is a festival for families. Now when the festival sets in, people would sit together to eat moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon, celebrate the bumper harvest and enjoy the family love and happiness. To the Chinese people, the full moon symbolizes family reunion, as does the "moon cakes." Hence the Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the Family Reunion Festival.

== Transport ==
[[Train|Trains]] are commonly used for moving from one place to another, mainly for long distances. [[Bullet train|Bullet trains]] are faster and more common in the cities. China has more high-speed trains than any other country in the world. [[Bus|Buses]] and [[air travel|air transport]] are also very common.

[[Category:People's Republic of China| ]]'''Psychoneuroimmunology''' ('''PNI''') is the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body.<ref>{{cite book | last = Michael Irwin| first = Kavita Vedhara | title = Human Psychoneuroimmunology| publisher = Oxford University Press|year=2005| isbn = 978-0-19-856884-1}}</ref> PNI takes an interdisciplinary approach.

The main interests of PNI are the interactions between the [[central nervous system|nervous]] and [[immune system]]s and the relationships between mental processes and [[health]]. 

==History==
Interest in the relationship between psychiatric syndromes or symptoms and immune function has been a consistent theme since the beginning of modern medicine.

[[Claude Bernard]], a French physiologist, founded the concept [[milieu interieur]] in the mid 1800s. In 1865, Bernard described the perturbation of this internal state “… there are protective functions of organic elements holding living materials in reserve and maintaining without interruption humidity, heat and other conditions indispensable to vital activity. Sickness and death are only a dislocation or perturbation of that mechanism." (Bernard, 1865) 

[[Walter Cannon]], a professor of physiology at [[Harvard University]] coined the term [[homeostasis]] in his book ''The Wisdom of the Body'' in 1932. In his work with animals Cannon observed that any change of emotional state in the beast, such as [[anxiety]], [[distress]], or [[rage (emotion)|rage]] was accompanied by total cessation of movements of the stomach (Bodily Changes in Pain, Hunger, Fear and Rage, 1915). These studies into the relationship between the effects of emotions and perceptions on the [[autonomic nervous system]], the  responses that led to the [[fight or flight response|freeze, fight or flight response]].  

===Birth of psychoneuroimmunology===
In 1975 Robert Ader and Nicholas Cohen advanced PNI with a demonstration of classic conditioning of the immune function, and coined the term "psychoneuroimmunology".<ref>R Ader and N Cohen. 1975.[http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/content/abstract/37/4/333 Behaviorally conditioned immunosuppression.] ''Psychosomatic Medicine''. '''37''', 333-340.</ref><ref name=roch>{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Robert Ader, Founder of Psychoneuroimmunology, Dies |url=http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/index.cfm?id=3370 |work=University of Rochester Medical Center |publisher= |date=2011-12-20 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}</ref> Ader was investigating how long [[conditioned response]]s  might last in laboratory rats. The highly reproducible results showed that conditioned rats exposed to the conditioned stimulus were immuno suppressed. In other words, a signal via the nervous system (taste) was affecting immune function. This was one of the first scientific experiments that demonstrated that the nervous system can affect the immune system.

In 1981 David Felten, then working at the [[Indiana University]] of Medicine, discovered a network of nerves leading to blood vessels as well as cells of the immune system. The researchers also found nerves in the [[thymus]] and [[spleen]] terminating near clusters of [[lymphocyte]]s, [[macrophage]]s and [[mast cell]]s, all of which help control immune function. This discovery provided one of the first indications of how neuro-immune interaction occurs.

Ader, Cohen and Felten went on to edit the groundbreaking book ''Psychoneuroimmunology'' in 1981, which laid out the underlying premise that the brain and immune system represent a single, integrated system of defense.

[[Category:Immunology]]
[[Category:Psychology]]A '''political party''' is an organized group of voters. It often puts forward candidates for [[public office]]. In a [[democracy]], leaders must "run for office" in an [[election]]. In a [[dictatorship]], there is generally only one party allowed, that can approve a new leader without non-members having a choice. 

== About ==
A political party is similar to a [[Political faction|faction]], and can be the same thing. In some systems, members of one party in the [[legislature]] are all expected to vote the same way. The laws written by the party or faction with the majority of votes become adopted by the country, so this means whatever party is elected to over half the seats, gets to run the government. The next largest party is often called the "opposition". Sometimes when there are more than two parties with seats, no one party has over half of the seats. Then two or more parties might join together to form what is called a "coalition".

Some parties are formed around a single issue or interest group. Others form policies to address all matters of government, known as a "platform".

Many political parties have a set of ideas and beliefs (called its "[[ideology]]"). People often describe these ideologies using words such as "rightwing" and "leftwing". 

Common ideologies include [[environmentalism]], [[socialism]] (ranging from [[social democracy]] to [[Marxism]] and [[Communism]]), [[conservatism]], [[democracy]], [[liberalism]], and [[nationalism]].

== The law ==

Political parties can be against the law in some places. When some parties get a lot of [[Influence|power]], they can make all other political parties illegal. For example, the [[Nazi Party]] did this in [[Germany]], and the [[Communist]] Party did it in several countries. Some countries make extreme-right parties illegal (such as [[Vlaams Blok]] in Belgium). At other times, countries have outlawed far-left parties. For example, [[West Germany]] banned the Communist Party in 1956.

A handful of countries like [[China]], [[North Korea]] and [[Cuba]] still have one-party dictatorships. In a few other dictatorships, such as [[Saudi Arabia]], all political parties are banned and there is no parliament at all.

== Importance in all big democracies ==

In all big democratic countries, parties are very important. But there are a few very small countries, such as the island of [[Jersey]], where most politicians do not belong to any party and where parties do not matter much.

In some democracies, there are only two big political parties. For example, in the United States, there is the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Some other parties exist but are very small and do not hold seats in Congress.

In other countries there are larger numbers of parties. In the German federal Parliament (or Bundestag), six parties have seats. In the United Kingdom, there are two big parties, one medium-sized party, and many small ones.

[[Category:Political parties| ]]A '''page''' can be different things:

* Usually, a '''page''' is a [[Matter|physical]] sheet of [[paper]] in a [[book]], [[magazine]], [[newspaper]] etc. When a page is not in a book (etc.) it is a ''sheet'' or ''piece'' of paper.

* When we talk about computers, a '''page''' is also a common [[abbreviation]] in [[net jargon]] for "[[webpage]]".  Here the page is not paper, it is a piece of information which we can see on a [[computer monitor]] at one time.  We can [[printing|print]] it to make a real page.  But the information may not fit all on one page, and we can not change it when it is printed - we can change a web page.  So a webpage is not always the same even as a printed copy of that page.  This is a [[conceptual metaphor]].  It can be confusing.  Someone who uses it is also likely to use other [[jargon]].

* A '''page''' is also a boy or a young man who helps carry things and does small jobs for someone. Another word for this is a ''pageboy''. 

* '''To page''' someone is to contact that person on their ''pager'': this is a small electronic machine which makes a sound or gives someone a message.

A '''pet''' is a [[domestication|domesticated]] [[animal]] that lives with people, but is not forced to [[Labour (economics)|work]] and is not [[eat]]en, in most instances. In most cases, a pet is kept to entertain people or for companionship. Some pets such as dogs and cats are placed in an animal shelter if there is no one willing to take care of it. If no one adopts it or the pet is too old/sick, the pet may be killed.

[[Dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[fish]], [[bird]]s are the most common pets in [[North America]].  [[Horse]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[ox]]en, and [[donkey]]s are usually made to work, so they are not usually called pets.  Some dogs also do work for people, and it was once common for some birds (like [[falcon]]s and carrier [[pigeon]]s) to work for [[human]]s.

[[Rodents]] are also very popular pets. The most common are [[guinea pig]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[hamsters]] (especially [[Syrian hamster|Syrian]] and [[dwarf hamster]]s), [[mouse|mice]] and [[rat]]s.

{{disambig}}[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|thumb|Plato, the person who created the idea of Platonic realism]]

'''Platonic realism''' is the [[metaphysics|theory of reality]] developed by [[Plato]], and explained in his [[theory of Forms]].  Platonic realism states that the visible world of particular things is a shifting exhibition, like shadows cast on a wall by the activities of their [[ontology|corresponding]] universal Ideas or Forms.  Whereas the visible world of particulars is unreal, the Forms occupy the unobservable yet true reality and are real.

'''Platonism''' is a similar, yet sometimes modified, view of reality.

== Origin ==

Among the natural philosophers in [[ancient Greece]], the problem of universals was the mystery of where particular things derive their traits that we perceive as universals—for instance ''red'' or ''apple'' or ''good'' or ''woman'' or ''truth''.

Plato explained that the particular things of the visible world are imperfect, transient copies of the universal Ideas that are the perfect, lasting Forms.  Existing exist outside [[space]] and [[time]], the Forms are the universals and act as [[template]]s from which particulars manifest.

In his ''Metaphysics'', Aristotle, a student of Plato, explained that [[Socrates]] and his own student Plato held it significant that the world is in flux, much as [[Heraclitus]] had commented, "You cannot step into the same river twice", a theme of the [[Eleatics]], a group of [[pre-socratic philosophers]].<ref name=Gomperz>Theodor Gomperz, ''Greek Thinkers: A History of Ancient Philosophy'', Vol III, Plato (London: Murray, 1905), pp 3, 84, 187, 207</ref>

== Influence ==

=== Plato's quest ===
Plato considered that only the mind could access the timeless reality of truths, the realm of the Forms casting the visible world.<ref name=Gomperz/><ref name=Heterhington>Norriss S Heterhington, ''Cosmology: Historical, Literary, Philosophical, Religious, and Scientific Perspectives'' (New York: Garland Publishing, 1993), [http://books.google.com/books?id=8lGNQMUTr0gC&pg=PA71&dq=Plato pp 71-4]</ref>  Plato's metaphorical [[allegory of the cave]]—whereby humans only know reality as shadows of the real things they see interacting on a wall—suggests the practical consequences of Platonic realism as to ''natural philosophy'' in its endeavor to explain the natural world and as to values in human society.  (Value theory comprises [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], and [[political philosophy]].)

Plato had led the focused application of geometry, developed by [[Euclid]], to explain the natural world.  Yet by his view of nature, Plato regarded astronomy as similar to seeking a theoretical proof in geometry—[[abstract]] and not the real world—whereupon the mind's insights derived from a quest to hold other truths through the mind's probing of ethics and aesthetics would yield discovery of truths within the realm of Forms, outside space and time.<ref name=Heterhington/>

=== Aristotle's answer ===

[[Aristotle]], a student of Plato, answered the problem of universals differently.  Aristotle explained that universals are concepts corresponding to [[traits]] borne and shared by the particular things themselves.  Aristotle did not regard all reality as visible, as he recognized existence of souls, yet regarded souls as unobserved parts of the visible world, real in itself.  [[Aristotelian realism]] largely shaped the course of Western thought.

Aristotle developed a more or less full description and explanation of the natural world and developed logic—syllogistic logic—to derive conclusions of the relations among things.  Aristotle's grounding in the visible world was a metaphysical approach that suggested what evolved by some 2 000 years later into [[epistemology|empirical]] [[science]].

== Platonism ==
 
Some [[mathematics|mathematicians]] and [[physics|physicists]] are Platonists,<ref name=Altmann>Simon L Altmann, [http://books.google.com/books/about/Is_nature_supernatural.html?id=ErTaAAAAMAAJ ''Is Nature Supernatural? A Philosophical Exploration of Science and Nature''] (Amherst NY: Prometheus Books, 2002)</ref> for instance Max Tegmark and Roger Penrose.<ref name=Holt>Jim Holt, ''Why Does the World Exist?: An Existential Detective Story'' (New York & London: Liveright, 2012), [http://books.google.com/books?id=WTVAftOH4-4C&pg=PT193&dq=Platonist+is+Max+Tegmark+Penrose p 182]</ref>  Yet today's Platonists usually view entities within the visible world as real, and simply regard universal abstractions like [[numbers]], [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], [[proposition]]s, and [[geometry]] as corresponding to real and timeless entities that also exist, though ''pure'' Platonists regard only the Forms or their realm as real.<ref name=Kukla>André Kukla, ''Studies in Scientific Realism'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), [http://books.google.com/books?id=L_wHvxLA5_EC&pg=PA4&dq=Timeless+abstract+entities+Platonism p4]</ref>

By way of [[string theory]] and the [[holographic principle]], some physicists conjecture that Plato's allegory of the cave approximates the natural world's structure.  Tegmark, who regards only the mathematical structure of the universe as real, has been called a ''radical'' Platonist.<ref name=Holt/>

[[File:Pinocchio paradox.jpg|thumb|The [[Pinocchio paradox]] is a variant of the [[Liar paradox]]]]

A '''paradox''' is a sentence in [[logic]] that cannot be [[true]] but also cannot be [[false]].  Many famous problems of this kind exist.

One of most famous paradoxes is called the '''liar's paradox'''.  It is the [[simple sentence]] "This sentence is a [[lying|lie]]."

If the sentence is true, then it is a lie, as it says.  But if it is a lie, how can it be true?  A lie cannot also be the [[truth]].  So the sentence being true makes it a lie.

If the sentence is a lie, then it is not as it says, it is true.  But that is just what the sentence says.  So that makes it true.  So the sentence being a lie makes it true.

This paradox is not just true in English but in any language powerful enough for a sentence to make a claim about itself.  This is true of [[mathematics]] as well.  Paradox can never be removed from any [[symbol]] system that makes claims about itself.

Another example is the statement that "there is no cabal".  Only a [[cabal]] can know if there is no cabal, so this is either a guess, or, it is a cabal trying to pretend it does not exist.

Other famous examples:

*[[Xeno's paradox]] of [[motion (physics)|motion]]
*[[Simpson's paradox]] in [[statistics]]

A paradox can also arise in [[ethics]].  Taking [[Influence|power]] over others is often also required to protect them, but also, one of the things being protected is their ability to do as they please, which this power interferes with.  There is another article on [[ethical dilemma]] which means "a paradox arising in ethics".

Because a paradox forces us to think "out of the box", about possibilities other than true or false in [[logic]], right or wrong in [[morality]], it is considered very important in [[education]].  People who do not see a paradox where others do, are likely to be too [[wikt:Certain|certain]] they are right.

== History ==
The potato is originally from the high and cool areas of the [[Andes]] of [[Peru]]. It was grown as a food crop more than 7,000 years ago.<ref name=pothis>{{cite web|url=http://www.indepthinfo.com/potato/history.shtml|title=Potato - History|publisher=www.indepthinfo.com|accessdate=2009-07-05|last=|first=}}</ref> When Spanish [[conquistador]]es came to South America in the 1500s they took potatoes back to [[Europe]].<ref name=pothis/> 

It took nearly 200 years for the potato to become a widely grown crop. In the 1780s the farmers in [[Ireland]] began growing potatoes because they grew well in the poor soils. They also have most of the [[vitamin]]s that people need to survive. The Irish became so [[wikt:dependent|dependent]] on the potato that when the crop failed in 1845 there was a [[famine]] and many people [[starvation|starved]] to death.<ref name=pothis/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyplace.com/worldhistory/famine/begins.htm|title=The History Place - Irish Potato Famine|publisher=www.historyplace.com|accessdate=2009-07-05|last=|first=}}</ref>

'''Plants''' are one of five big groups ([[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]]) of living things. They are [[autotroph]]ic [[eukaryote]]s, which means they have complex [[cell (biology)|cells]], and make their own food. Usually they cannot move (not counting [[Cell growth|growth]]).

Plants include familiar types such as [[tree]]s, [[herb]]s, [[Shrub|bushes]], [[grass]]es, [[vine]]s, [[fern]]s, [[moss]]es, and [[green algae]]. The scientific study of plants, known as [[botany]], has identified about 350,000 [[extant]] (living) [[species]] of plants. [[Fungus|Fungi]] and non-green [[algae]] are not [[biological classification|classified]] as plants. 

Most plants grow in the ground, with [[Plant stem|stem]]s above, and [[root]]s below. Some float on water. Water and some nutrients come from the roots. Then climb the stem and reach the leaves. The evaporation of water from pores in the [[leaf|leaves]] pulls water through the plant. This is called [[transpiration]]. 

A plant needs [[sunlight]], [[carbon dioxide]], minerals and [[water]] to make food by [[photosynthesis]]. A green substance in plants called [[chlorophyll]] traps the [[energy]] from the Sun needed to make food. Chlorophyll is mostly found in leaves, inside [[plastid]]s, which are inside the [[leaf]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. The leaf can be thought of as a food factory. Leaves of plants vary in shape and size, but they are always the plant organ best suited to capture solar energy. Once the food is made in the leaf, it is transported to the other parts of the plant such as stems and roots.<ref>Asimov, Isaac 1968. ''Photosynthesis''. Basic Books, New York, London.

The word "plant" can also mean to put something in the earth. For example, [[farm]]ers plant [[seed]]s in the ground.

== The plant food factory ==
[[File:Plagiomnium affine laminazellen.jpeg|thumb|250px|Chloroplasts visible in the cells of ''Plagiomnium affine'']]
At least some plant cells contain [[photosynthetic]] [[organelle]]s ([[plastid]]s) which enable them to make [[food]] for themselves. With [[sunlight]], [[water]], and [[carbon dioxide]], the plastids make [[sugar]]s, the basic [[molecule]]s needed by the plant. Free [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) is produced as a by-product of photosynthesis.<ref>Smith A.L. 1997. ''Oxford dictionary of biochemistry and molecular biology''. Oxford University Press. p508 ISBN 0-19-854768-4. "Photosynthesis -- the synthesis by organisms of organic chemical compounds, esp. carbohydrates, from carbon dioxide using energy obtained from light rather than the oxidation of chemical compounds".</ref> 

Later, in the cell cytoplasm, the sugars may be turned into [[amino acids]] for [[protein]]s, [[nucleotide]]s for [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], and [[carbohydrate]]s such as [[starch]]. This process needs certain [[mineral]]s: [[nitrogen]], [[potassium]], [[phosphorus]], [[iron]] and [[magnesium]].<ref>Rabinowitch E. and Govindjee 1969. ''Photosynthesis''. Wiley, London. ISBN 0-471-70424-5</ref>

=== Plant nutrients ===
Plant nutrition is the study of the [[chemical element]]s that are necessary for plant growth. 

Macronutrients:
* N = [[Nitrogen]] (proteins)
* P = [[Phosphorus]] ([[ATP]] and the energy cycle)
* K = [[Potassium]] (water regulation)
* Ca = [[Calcium]] (transport of other nutrients)
* Mg = [[Magnesium]] ([[enzyme]]s)
* S = [[Sulfur]] (some [[amino acid]]s)
* Si = [[Silicon]] (cell walls)

Micronutrients (trace elements) include:
* Cl = [[Chlorine]] ([[osmosis]] and [[ion]] balance)
* Fe = [[Iron]] (photosynthesis ans enzyme co-factor)
* B = [[Boron]] ([[sugar]] transport and [[cell division]])
* Mn = [[Manganese]] (building chloroplasts)
* Na = [[Sodium]] (various)
* Zn = [[Zinc]] (many enzymes)
* Cu = [[Copper]] (photosynthesis)
* Ni=  [[Nickel]] (an enzyme)
* Mo = [[Molybdenum]] (enzyme co-factors)

== Roots ==
The [[root]]s of plants perform two main functions. First, they anchor the plant to the ground. Second, they absorb [[water]] and various [[nutrient]]s dissolved in water from the [[soil]]. Plants use the water to make food. The water also provides the plant with support. Plants that lack water become very limp and their stems cannot support their [[Leaf|leaves]]. Plants which specialise in [[desert]] areas are called [[xerophyte]]s or phreatophytes, depending on the type of root growth.


Water is transported from the roots to the rest of the plant through special vessels in the plant. When the water reaches the leaves, some of it [[evaporate]]s into the air. Many plants need the help of [[fungi]] to make their roots work properly. This plant/fungi [[symbiosis]] is called [[mycorrhiza]]. [[Rhizobia]] [[bacteria]] in root nodules help some plants get [[nitrogen]].<ref>Mauseth, James D. 2003. ''Botany: an introduction to plant biology''. Jones & Bartlett, Boston.</ref>

== Flowering plant reproduction ==
{{main|Flowering plant sexuality}}
=== Flowers and pollination ===
[[Flowers]] are the reproductive organ only of ''flowering'' plants ([[Angiosperm]]s). The petals of a flower are often brightly colored and scented to attract [[insect]]s and other pollinators. The [[stamen]] is the male part of the plant. It is composed of the ''filament'' (a stalk) that holds the [[anther]], which produces the pollen. [[Pollen]] is needed for plants to produce seeds. The [[carpel]] is the female part of the flower. The top part of the carpel contains the [[stigma (botany)|stigma]]. The [[Carpel|style]] is the neck of the carpel. The [[ovary (botany)|ovary]] is the swollen area at the bottom of the carpel. The ovary produces the seeds. The [[sepal]] is a leaf that protects a flower as a bud.

The process by which pollen gets transferred from one flower to another flower is called [[pollination]]. This transfer can happen in different ways. Insects such as [[bee]]s are attracted to bright, scented flowers. When bees go into the flower to gather [[nectar]], the spiky pollen sticks to their back legs. The sticky stigma on another flower catches the pollen when the bee lands or flies nearby it. 

Some flowers use the wind to carry pollen. Their dangling stamens produce lots of pollen that is light enough to be carried by the wind. Their flowers are usually small and not highly coloured. The stigmas of these flowers are feathery and hang outside the flower to catch the pollen as it falls.<ref>Pous, Dinora. ''Science and plants''. Blue Planet.</ref>

=== Seed travellers ===
A plant produces many [[spore]]s or [[seed]]s. Lower plants such as [[moss]] and [[fern]]s produce spores. The [[seed plant]]s are the [[Gymnosperm]]s and Angiosperms. If all the seeds fell to the ground besides the plant, the area might become overcrowded. There might not be enough water and minerals for all the seeds. Seeds usually have some way to get to new places. Some seeds can be dispersed by the wind or by water. Seeds inside juicy fruits are dispersed after being eaten. Sometimes, seeds stick to animals and are dispersed that way.<ref>Fenner, Michael and Thompson, Ken 2005. ''The ecology of seeds''. Cambridge. ISBN 978-0-521-65368-8</ref>

== Fossils ==
The question of the earliest plant fossils depends on what is meant by the word "plant". 
#If by plants we mean [[phototroph]]s using [[chlorophyll]], then [[cyanobacteria]] in [[stromatolites]] are the first fossils, 3,450 million years ago (mya) in the [[Archaean]] [[eon]]. The remarkable precision is possible because the fossils were sandwiched between [[lava]] flows that could be precisely [[radiometric dating|dated]] from embedded [[zircon]] [[crystals]].<ref>J. William Schopf 1999. ''Cradle of Life: the discovery of Earth's earliest fossils''. Princeton U. Press (pages 87-89 and figure 3.9) ISBN 0-691-00230-4</ref><ref>Knoll, Andrew H. 2004. ''Life on a young planet: the first three billion years of evolution on Earth''. Princeton, N.J. ISBN 0-691-12029-3</ref>
#If by plants we mean green plants, [[Viridiplantae]], then the first fossils are [[green algae]]. This is probably the majority position amongst professional botanists. There is convincing evidence for the [[monophyly]] of [[charophyte]] [[green algae]] and [[embryophytes]].<ref>{{cite journal |quotes=no |author=Lewis L.A & R.M. McCourt 2004 |title=Green algae and the origin of land plants|journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=91 |issue=10 |pages=1535–1556 |url=http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/reprint/91/10/1535?maxtoshow=&HITS=10&hits=10&RESULTFORMAT=&searchid=1&FIRSTINDEX=0&sortspec=relevance&volume=91&firstpage=1535&resourcetype=HWCIT}}</ref> There are still two choices:
##[[Acritarch]]s (a group of organic-walled microfossils) may be reproductive [[cyst]]s of green algae. If so, they are present in the [[Neoproterozoic]] [[era]], 1000 mya.<ref name=Willis>Willis K.J. & McElwain J.C. 2002. ''The evolution of land plants''. Oxford University Press, 38. ISBN 0-19-850065-3</ref>
##Otherwise, there is a large increase in [[plankton]]ic algae around 540 mya in the [[Cambrian]] period.<ref name=Willis/>
#If by plants we mean [[land plants]], the first fossils are in the [[Silurian]].<ref name=Wellman>Wellman, Charles H.; Osterloff, Peter L. & Mohiuddin, Uzma 2003. Fragments of the earliest land plants. ''Nature'' '''425''': 282–285. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6955/full/nature01884.html]</ref> 

By the [[Silurian]], fossils of whole plants are preserved, including the [[lycophyte]] ''[[Baragwanathia longifolia]]''. From the [[Devonian]], detailed fossils of [[rhyniophyte]]s have been found. Early fossils of these ancient plants show the individual cells within the plant tissue. The Devonian period also saw the evolution of the first tree in the fossil record, ''[[Wattezia]]''. This fern-like tree had a trunk with  fronds, and produced [[spores]].

The [[Coal measure]]s are a major source of [[Palaeozoic]] plant fossils, with many groups of plants in existence at this time. The spoil heaps of coal mines are the best places to collect; [[coal]] itself is the remains of fossilised plants, though structural detail of the plant fossils is rarely visible in coal. In the Fossil Forest at Victoria Park in [[Glasgow]] the stumps of ''[[Lepidodendron]]'' trees are found in their original growth positions.

[[Category:Plants| ]]A '''prediction''' is a statement that someone makes about what they think is going to happen. It is often very helpful to know what is going to happen to help prepare for these [[future]] [[event]]s. Predictions are based on the [[idea]] that two beginning [[position]]s that are like each other will have [[similar]] results. By watching something happen, it is possible to predict what will happen if something similar happens. Predictions are given by [[science]] or fortune tellers or [[horoscope]]s. 

The most common [[example]] of a prediction is the [[weather]] [[forecast]]. Studying how weather happens lets people predict what the weather will be by looking at what is currently happening. This is helpful because by knowing that it is going to [[rain]], a person can wear the right [[clothing|clothes]] for it.

[[Nostradamus]] has made many predictions about the future.

'''Probability''' is a part of [[mathematics]]. It has to do with chance, the study of things that might happen or might not happen. 

For example, using probability, you can show that if you throw a coin up in the air and let it land, half of the time it will land with one side facing up, and half the time with the other side facing up. Many coins have a picture of the face of a famous person on one side, and something else on the other side. Often people call the side with the face "heads", and the other side "tails".

'''The probability (p) of an event is always between zero (impossible) and one (certain).'''

If we roll a [[dice|die]] ([[plural]]: [[dice]]), then the chance that it will land on 1 is 1/6 (This is because there are 6 numbers on a die). Also, the chance it will land on 2 is 1/6. This is because it can land on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. 
The chance of any number between 1 and 6 landing is 1. Every time we roll the die, it will always land on a number between 1 and 6.

Probability can be figured out using [[mathematics]]. For example if you roll six dice, the chance of you getting a number more than ten is not obvious, but can be figured out using math and science.

One of the most interesting things about chance is that to figure out the probability that two things will both happen you multiply their two probabilities together. For instance, suppose that you want to know the probability of rolling two dice and getting a certain combination (it could be two 6s or a 3 then a 5, just any two). The possibility of getting a 3 is one in six (⅙) and the possibility of getting a 5 is also one in six, so the chances of getting a 3 then a 5 is ⅙×⅙=⅟36. If that number is expressed as somewhere between 0 and 1, it equals 0.027...7, which is fairly low. The possibility of getting a 3, then a 5, and then a 2 would be ⅙×⅙×⅙=⅟216 or 0.00463, which is a much lower probability.Possible event is 1, whereas impossible event is 0.

== Ideas of probablity ==
People like [[Jacob Bernoulli]], [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], or [[Christiaan Huygens]] used the word probability, as described above. Other people thought about frequencies; ther notion of probability is usually called [[Frequency probability]].

[[Category:Mathematics]]A '''probability experiment''' is a [[wikt:situation|situation]] where [[chance]] affects the [[wikt:result|result]] of an experiment.  If the experiment can only have two outcomes, it is named [[Bernoulli trial]]. A [[coin]] flip is a probability experiment because [[chance]] affects whether a [[coin]] will land [[head|heads]] or [[tail|tails]] when it is flipped.

'''Proteins''' are long-chain [[molecule]]s built from small units known as [[amino acid]]s. They are joined together with [[peptide bond]]s. 

They are [[biochemistry|biochemical]] [[Chemical compound|compounds]] consisting of one or more [[polypeptide]]s folded into a round or [[fibrous protein|fibrous]] shape.<ref>See [[protein structure]] for more on this topic.</ref>

A polypeptide is a single linear [[polymer]] chain of [[amino acid]]s. The [[sequence]] of amino acids in a polypeptide comes from the [[DNA sequence]] of a [[gene]].<ref>see [[Translation (genetics)]] and [[RNA splicing]] for a fuller account.</ref> The [[genetic code]] specifies 20 standard amino acids. Shortly after synthesis, some amino acids are chemically modified. This alters the folding, stability, activity, and function of the protein. Sometimes proteins have non-peptide groups attached, as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s.

Proteins are essential to all [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. Like other biological [[macromolecule]]s ([[polysaccharide]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s), proteins take part in virtually every process in cells: 
#Many proteins are [[enzyme]]s that [[catalysis|catalyze]] biochemical reactions and are vital to [[metabolism]]. 
#Other proteins have structural or mechanical functions, such as in muscle and in [[cell]]s. The [[cytoskeleton]] is a system of [[scaffolding]] that keeps cell shape. 
#Other proteins are important in [[Signal transduction|cell signalling]], [[antibody|immune response]]s, and [[cell division]].

== Proteins for humans ==
[[Image:Eggisprotein.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Egg whites contain a lot of protein]]

Proteins do different things depending on their shape. They can be found in [[meat]] or [[muscle]]. They are used for growth and repair, as well as for strengthening the bones. They help to make tissue and cells. They are in [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, fungi, bacteria, and also in the [[human]] body. 

[[Muscle]]s contain a lot of protein. When protein is digested, it is broken down into its amino acids. These amino acids can then be used to build new protein. Proteins form an important part in foods like [[milk]], [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[meat]], [[fish]], [[bean]]s, and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]]. There are four things that determine what a protein will do. The first is the order of the amino acids. There are 20 amino acids, and they are all a bit different. The second is the little twists in the chain. The third is how the entire thing is folded up. The fourth is whether it is made up of different sub-units. [[Haemoglobin]] molecules, for example, are made of four sub-units.

=== Essential amino acids ===
Proteins are necessary in animals' diets, since animals cannot make all the amino acids they need (they can make most of them). They must get certain amino acids from food. These are called the ''essential amino acids''. Through [[digestion]], animals break down ingested protein into free amino acids. The amino acids are then used in [[metabolism]] to make the [[enzyme]]s and structures the body needs.

There are nine essential amino acids for humans, which must be got from food. Meat contains all the essential amino acids humans need; most plants do not. However, eating a mixture of plants, such as both [[wheat]] ''and'' [[peanut butter]], or [[rice]] ''and'' [[bean]]s, provides all the essential amino acids needed. [[Soy]] products like [[tofu]] provide all the essential amino acids as does [[quinoa]] but these are not the only way to get the protein you need.

The scientist [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]] gave proteins their name,<ref name="Hartley">{{cite journal|last=Hartley|first=Harold|date= 1951|title=Origin of the word 'protein'|journal=Nature|volume=168|issue=244|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v168/n4267/abs/168244a0.html}}</ref> but many other scientists have studied proteins.

[[Category:Molecular biology]][[File:Periodic table.svg|thumb|300px|right|The standard variation of the periodic table]]
The '''periodic table of the chemical elements''' is a list of known [[Atom|atoms]]. In the [[Table (information)|table]], the elements are placed in the order of their [[atomic number]]s starting with the lowest number. The atomic number of an element is the same as the number of  [[protons]] in that particular [[atom]].

In the periodic table the elements are arranged into ''[[Period (periodic table)|periods]]'' and ''[[Group (periodic table)|groups]]''. 

A row of elements across the table is called a ''period''. Each period has a number: from 1 to 7. Period 1 has only 2 elements in it: [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]. Period 2 and Period 3 both have 8 elements. Other periods are longer.

A column of elements down the table is called a ''group''. There are 18 groups in the standard periodic table. Each group has a number: from 1 to 18. Elements in a group have electrons arranged in similar ways, which gives them similar [[chemical property|chemical properties]] (they behave in similar ways). For example, group 18 is known as the [[noble gas]]es because they are all gases and they do not combine with other atoms.

The periodic table can be used by [[chemist]]s to observe patterns, and relationships between the elements. For example, elements to the bottom and far left of the table are the most [[metal|metallic]], and elements on the top right are the [[nonmetal|least metallic]]. (e.g. [[cesium]] is much more metallic than [[helium]]). There are also many other patterns and relationships.

There are two systems of group numbers; one using [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system|Arabic numerals]] (1,2,3) and the other two using [[Roman numeral]]s (I, II, III). The Roman numeral names were used at first and are the traditional names; the Arabic numeral names are newer names that the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) decided to use as well. The IUPAC names were meant to replace the older Roman numeral systems as they used the same names to mean different things, which was confusing.

The Periodic Table was invented and arranged by the [[Russia]]n [[chemist]] [[Dmitri Mendeleev|Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev]] ([[1834]]-[[1907]]).

[[Category:Periodic table| ]]'''Physiology''' is the study of how [[Life|living things]] work. Physiologists can study how [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] of an [[organism]] work together to make things happen. In [[human being]]s, for example, the [[digestion]] of [[food]] [[hormone]]s and other [[chemical]]s are made by the [[stomach]], [[liver]], and [[pancreas]]. [[Muscle]] contraction happens because of chemical messages made by [[nerve]]s of that muscle. By learning how the body functions normally, physiologists and [[physician]]s can better understand what happens when organs do not function normally. For example, an understanding of how the [[thyroid gland]] functions has helped in treating [[goitre]]. Studies of the [[circulatory system]] and the [[nervous system]] have helped physicians understand and treat such [[illness]]es like [[heart disease]], [[Stroke (medicine)|stroke]], and [[high blood pressure]].

The field is usually divided into human physiology,<ref>Hall, John 2011. ''Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology''. 12th ed, Philadelphia, Pa: Saunders/Elsevier.

<onlyinclude>A '''planet''' is a large object such as [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] or [[Earth]] that [[orbit]]s a [[star]]. It is smaller than a star, and it does not make [[light]]. 

Planets are shaped like a slightly squashed ball (a [[spheroid]]). Objects that orbit planets are called [[Satellite (natural)|satellites]]. A star and everything which orbits it are called a star system. 

There are eight planets in our [[Solar System]]. [[Pluto]] used to be called a planet, but in August 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] decided it was a [[dwarf planet]] instead. There are four more known dwarf planets in the Solar System, [[1 Ceres|Ceres]], [[Makemake (dwarf planet)|Makemake]], [[136199 Eris|Eris]] and [[Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea]].

The name "planet" is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word πλανήτης (''planetes''), meaning "wanderers", or "things that move". Until the 1990s, people only knew of those in the Solar System. As of June 2011, we know of 563 other planets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jean Schneider|title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog|url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php|work=The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia|accessdate=2011-06-23}}</ref> All of these newly found planets are orbiting other stars: they are [[Extrasolar planet|''extrasolar'' planets]]. Sometimes people call them "exoplanets".</onlyinclude>

[[File:Planets2008.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Planets from the [[solar system]].]]
The planets in the Solar System have names of [[Greek mythology|Greek]] or [[Roman mythology|Roman]] gods, apart from Earth, because people did not think Earth was a planet in old times. However, Earth is occasionally referred by the name of a Roman god: ''Terra''. Other languages, for example [[Chinese language|Chinese]], use different names. Moons also have names of gods and people from classical [[myth]]ology, or from the [[theatre|plays]] written by [[Shakespeare]].

=== Types of planets ===
Astronomers speak about ''major'' (or true) planets, and [[minor planet]]s, which are smaller objects that go around the Sun. Some examples of "minor planets" are [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[trans-Neptunian object]]s.

Planets in the Solar System are of three sorts:
* [[Terrestrial planet|''Terrestrial'' or ''rocky'']]: Planets that are similar to Earth — in them is mostly [[Rock (geology)|rock]]: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars. 
* [[Gas giant|''Jovian'' or ''gas giant'']]: These planets are mostly made of [[gas]]: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Uranian planets are a special sort of gas giants, they have more [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].
* [[Ice dwarf|''Icy'']]: Sometimes people also have a third sort, for bodies such as [[Pluto]] (though Pluto is no longer called a planet by everyone). These planets are mostly made of [[ice]].
Many objects in the Solar System that are not planets are also "icy". Examples are the icy moons of the outer planets of the Solar System (like [[Triton (moon)|Triton]]).

[[Category:Politics of China]][[File:Police.three.on.patrol.london.arp.jpg|thumb|right|250px|{{Center|[[United Kingdom|British]] police officers in [[London]].}}]]
'''Police''' are a group of people whose job it is to [[wikt:enforce|enforce]] [[law]]s, help with [[Emergency|emergencies]], solve [[crime]]s and [[protection|protect]] property. People who work for the police are called '''police officers''' or '''policemen'''. They work out of a police station. Police are trained in [[first aid]] and [[rescue]], because police officers are often one of the first people to get to a place where people are [[illness|sick]] or [[injury|injured]], such as a [[car]] [[accident]], or a [[fire]].

==Powers==
The police  have different powers to help them do their [[job]]. These powers are different in different [[Country|countries]]. Most police officers have the power to [[arrest]] people, search people, and search [[house]]s/properties. They sometimes carry [[wikt:equipment|equipment]] such as [[gun]]s, [[baton]]s and [[pepper spray]]. The area where a police officer can use these powers is called their [[jurisdiction]]. If the officer goes outside of his jurisdiction, they are no longer allowed to use his powers. Another police force has to then take over.

==Duties==
The police deal with;
* Stopping crime and protecting the public. They do this by [[patrol]]ling on foot in [[uniform]] and in police cars. It is often agreed that seeing police officers makes people feel safer and that it stops some some forms of [[crime|criminal behavior]].
* investigating crime.  This means that they find out who did the crime.  Some crimes, such as [[robbery]] or [[murder]] are investigated by [[detective]]s.
* To help in emergencies or problems the that are not crimes. They could go to car accidents, fires, or people who are sick or hurt. The police work with [[firefighter]]s, [[ambulance]]s, and rescuers. They could direct [[traffic]], help lost children, give traffic [[citation|ticket]]s, and many other things.

==Parts of police departments==
Most police departments have most of their officers in two main groups: a "patrol" group that has officers who wear uniforms, and a "detective" group that has officers who wear normal clothing. 

*Patrol officers travel through their area to see what is happening. They drive marked cars with warning [[light]]s and [[siren]]s (makes [[sound]] to warn people). Patrol officers also enforce traffic [[regulation]]s and run the local [[jail]].
*Detectives work on [[investigation]]s that are more complex. They try to find [[fraud]], [[illegal drug]]s, and [[sex]] crimes like [[prostitution]] and [[rape]]. (Prostitution is not a crime in all countries.)

Not all countries use the same words to describe these groups. In the [[United Kingdom]], for example, patrol officers form the "uniform branch", while detectives work within the CID ("Criminal Investigation Department"). Police uniforms, equipment and methods can change a lot depending on the country. In some areas, groups of police are train for special jobs such as dealing with [[riot]]s or when a situation is very bad. 

[[File:Police Poland 2 AB.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A [[Poland|Polish]] police officer with some of his equipment]]
==Police in different countries==
Different countries have different names for their police.  In [[Ireland]], they are called the ''Garda''. In [[Russia]], they were called the ''Militsiyer'' until 2012; now, they are called the ''Politsiyer'', closer to the English "police".  Other names for police services are sheriff's office, marshal's office or department of public safety.  In the same country there can be different types of police officer who have powers in different areas and situations, such as [[state]] police, [[military]] police and local police. Worldwide, police make up a small percentage of the people they serve. On average there are 303.3 police officers per 100,000 population.<ref>''International Statistics on Crime and Justice'', eds. S. Harrendorf; M. Heiskanen; S. Malby (Helsinki, European Institute for United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), 2010), p. 115</ref> 

[[File:Picassoz03x.JPG|thumb|A [[Spain|Spanish]] police car]]

==Equipment==
In most countries, police officers have been trained to carry guns. Even in countries like the United Kingdom, [[New Zealand]] and the Republic of Ireland where most police officers do not carry guns, more are being trained to do so because gun crime is getting worse. [[gun|Firearms]] training teaches that the use of a firearm is only when lives are at risk.

This produces a number, and that number is always the same. However, the number is rather strange. The number starts 3.14159265... and continues without end. Numbers like this are called [[Irrational number|irrational]] numbers.

The diameter is the longest line which can be fitted inside a circle. It passes through the center of the circle. The distance around a circle is known as the [[circumference]]. Even though the diameter and circumference are different for different circles, the number pi remains constant: its value never changes. This is because the relationship between the circumference and diameter is always the same.<ref>Lennart Berggren, Jonathan M. Borwein, and Peter B. Borwein (eds.), ''Pi: A Source Book''. 2nd ed, Springer, 1999. ISBN 978-0-387-98946-4</ref>

[[File:Pi-unrolled-720.gif|thumb|right|A diagram showing how <math>\\pi</math> can be found by using a [[circle]] with a [[diameter]] of [[one]]. The [[circumference]] of this circle is <math>/pi</math>.]]
Pi is often written formally as '''<math>\\pi</math>''' or the Greek letter '''π''' as a shortcut.  Pi is also an [[irrational number]], meaning it cannot be written as a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] (<math>a \\over b</math>), where 'a' and 'b' are [[integer]]s (whole numbers). This basically means that the digits of pi that are to the right of the [[decimal]] go [[Infinity|forever]] without repeating in a pattern, and that it is impossible to write the exact value of pi as a number. Pi can only be [[approximated]], or measured to a value that is close enough for practical purposes.<ref name="About Pi">{{cite web |url=http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.pi.html |title=About Pi |accessdate=2010-06-05 |author=[http://goodwin.drexel.edu/ Goodwin College of Professional Studies]. |date=1994-2010 |format=html}}</ref>

A value close to pi is 3.1415926535897932384626433... A common fraction approximation of pi is <math>22 \\over 7</math>, which yields approximately 3.14285714. This approximation is 0.04% away from the true value of pi. While this approximation is accepted for most of its use in real life, the fraction <math>355 \\over 113</math> is more accurate (giving about 3.14159292), and can be used when a value closer to pi is needed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zenwerx.com/pi.php |title=Pi to 4 Million Decimals |accessdate=2010-06-05 |format=php}}</ref> [[Computer]]s can be used to get better approximations of pi.

== History ==
The value of pi was known to Ancient Indian mathematicians like Bhaskaracharya and Aryabhatt.

[[Mathematician]]s have known about pi for thousands of years because they have been working with circles for the same amount of time. [[Civilizations]] as old as the [[Babylonia]]ns have been able to approximate pi to many digits, such as the fraction 25/8 and 256/81. Most historians believe that [[ancient Egypt]]ians had no concept of π and that the correspondence is a coincidence.<ref name="unleashed">Arndt, Jörg & Haenel, Christoph 2006. ''Pi unleashed''. Springer-Verlag, 168. ISBN 978-3-540-66572-4</ref><!-- correspondence to what? --Mar 1 2016 -->

The first written reference to pi dates to 1900 BC.<ref>Beckmann, Petr 1971. ''A History of Pi''. St. Martins Press, London.</ref> Around 1650 BC the Egyptian Ahmes gave a value in the ''Rhind Papyrus''. The Babylonians were able to find that the value of pi was slightly [[greater than]] 3 by simply making a big circle and then sticking a piece of rope onto the circumference and the diameter, taking note of their distances, and then dividing the circumference by the diameter.

Knowledge of the number pi passed back into [[Europe]] and into the hands of the [[Hebrews]], who made the number important in a section of the [[Bible]] called the [[Old Testament]]. After this, the most common way of trying to find pi was to [[wikt:inscribe|draw]] a shape of many sides inside any circle and use the [[area]] of the [[polygon|shape]] to find pi. The Greek philosopher [[Archimedes]], for example, used a [[polygon]] shape that had 96 sides in order to find the value of pi, but the Chinese in 500 A.D. were able to use a polygon with 16,384 sides to find the value of pi. The Greeks, like [[Anaxagoras]] of Clazomenae, were also busy with finding out other properties of the circle, such as how to make squares of circles and squaring the number pi. Since then, many people have been trying to find out more and more exact values of pi.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Pi_through_the_ages.html |title=Pi History |accessdate=2010-06-05 |coauthors=J.J.

In the 16th century, better and better ways of finding pi became available such as the complicated [[formula]] that the French lawyer François Viète developed. The first use of the Greek symbol "π" was in an essay written in 1706 by William Jones.

A [[mathematician]] named Lambert also [[proved|showed]] in 1761 that the number pi was [[irrational number|irrational]]; that is, it cannot be written as a fraction by normal standards. Another mathematician named Lindeman was also able to show in 1882 that pi was part of the group of numbers known as [[transcendentals]], which are numbers that cannot be the solution to a [[polynomial]] equation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.math.com/tables/constants/pi.htm |title=PI |accessdate=2010-06-06 |date=2000-2005 |format=htm}}</ref>

Pi can also be used for figuring out many other things beside circles.<ref name=unleashed/> The properties of pi have allowed it to be used in many other areas of math besides [[geometry]], which studies shapes. Some of these areas are [[complex analysis]], [[trigonometry]], and [[Series (mathematics)|series]].

== Pi in real life ==
Today, there are different ways to calculate many digits of <math>\\pi</math>. This is of limited use though.

Pi can sometimes be used to work out the area or the circumference of any circle. To find the circumference of a circle, use the formula C (circumference) = π times [[diameter]]. To find the area of a circle, use the formula π ([[radius]]²). This formula is sometimes written as <math>A = \\pi r^2</math>, where ''r'' is the [[variable]] for the radius of any circle and ''A'' is the variable for the area of that circle.

To calculate the circumference of a circle with an error of 1&nbsp;mm:
* 4 digits are needed for a radius of 30 meters
* 10 digits for a radius equal to that of the earth
* 15 digits for a radius equal to the distance from the earth to the sun.

People generally celebrate March 14 as [[Pi Day]] because March 14 is also written as 3/14, which represents the first three numbers 3.14 in the [[approximation]] of pi.<ref name="About Pi"/>

[[no:Substantiv#Egennavn vs. fellesnavn]][[File:Plastic household items.jpg|thumb|300px|right|These objects are all made out of plastic.]]
A '''plastic''' is a [[material]] that can change its shape, so many things can be made of plastic. There are many types of plastic. Some can be shaped only when they are freshly made; then they become hard. Others can be changed by heating them up or even by [[melting]] them. 

Most plastics are man-made; they do not occur in nature.  Most are made from [[petroleum]] or [[natural gas]].  The process of making plastics is usually quite complicated. Most of the materials that are called ''plastic'' are [[polymer]]s. Polymers are long chains of [[atoms]] bonded to one another.

People experimented with plastics based on natural polymers for a very long time. [[Alexander Parkes]], an English inventor (1813-1890), created the earliest form of plastic in 1855. It was hard but flexible and transparent, and he called it "Parkesine."

Plastic is filling up the landfills and sometimes if you burn it, it releases toxic fumes. If we  do not recycle, it becomes waste.

== Plastic Formulation ==
Plastics are mostly [[petrochemical]]s, made from [[petroleum]], a type of [[oil]]. [[Engineer]]s refine the petroleum which goes through a heating process. It develops [[ethylene]] and [[propylene]], which are the chemical building blocks for many plastics. These chemicals are then combined with other chemicals to produce a [[polymer]].

== Well-known plastics, and their use ==
*Polyamide (usually called [[nylon]]) {{ndash}} Women's [[stocking]]s.
*[[Polycarbonate]] – [[bulletproof glass]], [[compact disc]]s, [[DVD]]s.
*[[Polyethylene]] – [[tube]]s made of plastic
*[[Polyethylene terephtalate]] (called PET when used for [[bottle]]s, and polyester when used for [[clothes]] or other materials)
*[[Polypropylene]]
*[[Polystyrene]]
*[[Polyurethane]]
*[[Polyvinyl chloride]] (called PVC, usually). Used for [[Insulator (electricity)|insulation]] of electric wires, but also for pipes and road signs.

'''Product stewardship''' includes [[waste disposal]] measures in the [[distribution]] of an [[industrial]] [[Product (consumer goods)|product]].  That is, paying for the safe and proper disposal when you pay for the product, and relying on those who sold it to you, to dispose of it.  

The slightly more specific idea of '''product take-back''' means that the service of [[waste disposal]] is paid for at time of [[wikt:purchase|purchase]].  It is often applied to [[paint]], [[tire]]s, and other goods that become [[toxic waste]] if not disposed of properly.  It is most familiar as the [[deposit bottle]] - where one pays for the [[loan]] of the bottle at the same time as one purchases what is inside it. The '''container deposit''' charged for a '''deposit bottle''' may be a [[fee]] to ''buy'' the bottle, separately from the fee to buy what it contains.  If one returns the bottle, the fee is returned, and the [[supplier]] must return the bottle for [[re-use]] or [[recycling]].  If not, one has paid the fee, and [[presumably]] this can pay for [[landfill]] or [[litter]] control measures that dispose of say a broken bottle.  Also, since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle, it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving.  This is quite common for instance among [[homeless]] people.

[[Legal]] [[requirement]]s [[vary]]:  the bottle itself may be considered simple [[property]] of the purchaser of the contents, or, the purchaser may have some [[obligation]] to return the bottle to some depot so it can be [[recycling|recycled]] or re-used.   For the more toxic items, it is more likely that returning it is required:

This principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to [[paint]] and [[automobile]] parts such as [[tire]]s.  When purchasing paint or tires in many places, one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the [[toxic waste]] they become.  In some countries, such as [[Germany]], [[law]] requires attention to the [[comprehensive outcome]] of the whole extraction, production, distribution, use and waste of a product, and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way.  This is also the trend in the [[UK]] and [[EU]] generally.  In the [[United States]], there have been many [[class action suit]]s that are effectively product stewardship [[liability]] - holding companies responsible for things the product does, which it was never advertised to do.

Rather than let liability for these problems be taken up by the [[public sector]] or be haphazardly [[assign]]ed one [[issue]] at a time to companies via [[lawsuit]]s, many [[accounting reform]] efforts focus on achieving [[full cost accounting]].  This is the [[financial capital|financial]] reflection of the [[comprehensive]] [[outcome]] - noting the gains and losses to all parties involved, not just those investing or purchasing.  Such moves have made [[moral purchasing]] more attractive, as it avoids [[liability]] and future lawsuits.

So these are [[partial]] [[implementation]]s of a [[strict]] [[service economy]] [[ideal]].

Those who [[advocate]] these measures are concerned with the later [[phase]]s of [[product lifecycle]] and the [[comprehensive outcome]] of the whole production process.  It is considered a pre-requisite to a strict [[service economy]] interpretation of (fictional, national, legal) "commodity" and "product" relationships.

'''Peace''' is a time without any [[fight]]s or [[war]]s. In a larger sense, peace (or '''peacefulness''') can mean a state of harmony, quiet or calm that is not disturbed by anything at all, like a still [[pond]] with no dogs

Peace within and among [[state]]s is a [[wikt:goal|goal]] of many people and [[organization]]s. One organization that was set up to bring peace among the nations and try to make war a thing of the past was the [[League of Nations]] after [[World War I]].  When it [[wikt:failed|failed]] to stop [[World War II]], it was replaced by the [[United Nations]] which tries to make the world peaceful. This means that if any member is attacked or invaded by another country without attacking that country first, the other members will come to help the country that was attacked first. This idea was used by the United Nations to defend both [[South Korea]] and [[Kuwait]] when they were attacked.

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King Jr.]] wrote in a [http://www.sas.upenn.edu/African_Studies/Articles_Gen/Letter_Birmingham.html letter he sent from the Birmingham jail] that, "True peace is not merely the absence of tension: it is the presence of [[:wikt:justice|justice]]." In other words, Real peace is more than just problems being gone: there must be fairness to have peace.

[[Alfred Nobel]] created an annual award, the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], for the person who had done the most to bring peace to the world.

== Religious beliefs and peace ==
[[File:Justitia et pax - Brescia - Pinacoteca Tosio-Martinengo - 13-4-2002.jpg|right|thumb|"Justice and Peace shall kiss" refers to [[Psalm]] 85]]

[[Buddhist]]s think that peace can be gotten once all suffering ends.{{fact|date=June 2013}}To get rid of suffering and get this peace, many try to follow a set of teachings called the [[Four Noble Truths]]{{fact|date=June 2013}}

[[Jews]] and [[Christians]] believe that true peace comes from a personal relationship with [[God]]. [[Jesus Christ]] (also called the "Prince of Peace" in the [[Book of Isaiah]]) said: "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid." ({{bibleverse||John|14:27|NIV}})

=== Inner peace ===
{{main|Inner peace}}
Inner peace (or peace of mind) refers to a state of being [[mind|mental]]ly and [[spirit]]ually at peace, with enough [[knowledge]] and understanding to keep oneself strong in the face of stress. Being "at peace" is considered by many to be healthy and the opposite of being stressed or anxious. Peace of mind is generally associated with bliss and happiness.

Peace of mind, serenity, and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress. In some cultures, inner peace is considered a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various forms of training, such as [[prayer]], [[meditation]], [[Tai chi chuan]] or [[yoga]], for example. Many spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself.

== Movements and [[activism]] ==
=== Peace movement ===
{{Main|Peace movement}}

A movement that seeks to get ideals such as the ending of a particular war, minimize inter-human violence in a particular place or type of situation, often linked to the goal of achieving [[world peace]]. Means to achieve these ends usually include advocacy of [[pacifism]], [[nonviolence|non-violent resistance]], [[conscientious objector]], [[diplomacy]], [[boycott]]s, [[moral purchasing]], supporting anti-war political candidates, [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], and [[lobbying]] to create legislation on [[human rights]] or of [[international law]].

== Theories on peace ==
Many different theories of "peace" exist in the world of [[peace studies]], which involves the study of conflict transformation. The definition of "peace" can vary with religion, culture, or subject of study.

Peace is a state of balance and understanding in yourself and between others, where respect is gained by the acceptance of differences, tolerance persists, conflicts are resolved through dialog, people's rights are respected and their voices are heard, and everyone is at their highest point of serenity without social tension.

[[File:Québec, Canada.svg|thumb|right|Quebec (in red) in Canada (in light yellow)]]
'''Quebec''' (spelled '''Québec''' in French) is a [[province]] in Eastern [[Canada]]. It is the largest of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canada's ten provinces]] by [[size]]. It also has the second-highest [[population|number of people]], after [[Ontario]]. Most of Quebec's inhabitants live along or close to the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. Not many people live in the north part of the province. 

Unlike the other provinces, most people in Quebec speak [[French language|French]] ([[Canadian French]]). There is a strong French-language [[culture]], which includes French-language [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[movie]]s, [[television]] and [[radio]] shows. Their culture and language, though, is different from that of [[France]] mainly because of [[anglicisation]], having words that come from the larger [[Canadian English|English-speaking]] parts of Canada.

The [[government]] of Quebec has its offices in the [[Capital (city)|capital]], [[Quebec City]], which is one of the oldest cities in [[North America]]. But the largest city in the province is [[Montreal]], which is also the second-largest city in all of Canada.

Quebec has many [[natural resource|natural resources]] that are used to create [[job]]s. Quebec also has many [[company|companies]] that create products for [[Information technology|information]] and [[communication]] technologies, [[Aerospace engineering|aerospace]], [[biotechnology]], and [[Health care|health]] [[Industrialization|industries]]. It has also developed close relations with the [[Northeastern United States]].

== Leaving Canada ==
Quebec was part of [[New France]] until 1760, then under [[British Empire|British control]]. Quebec became a province in the Canadian Confederation in 1867. Since then, some people in Quebec have wanted to leave Canada. Since Quebec is a mainly French-speaking province, most of the people there feel that it is very different from the rest of Canada, and want to keep it that way. Some feel that for this to happen, Quebec must [[Succession|leave Canada]] and become its own [[country]]. However, the people of Quebec are still divided as to its place in Canada. 

Quebec held [[Democracy|democratic]] [[vote|votes]] in 1980 and 1995 to decide whether to leave Canada. In 1995, the people of Quebec chose to stay in Canada by a 1% margin.

== History of Quebec ==
[[Indigenous peoples|Aboriginal]] people and [[Inuit]] groups were the first peoples who lived in what is now Québec. These Aboriginal people lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing. Some of the Aboriginal people, called [[Iroquoian|Iroquoians]], planted squash and [[maize]]. The Inuit fished and [[whaler|hunted whales]] and seals for fur and food. Sometimes they [[war|warred]] with each other.

[[Viking|Vikings]] came in [[longboat|longboats]] from [[Scandinavia]] in 1000 AD. [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] whalers and fishermen traded furs with Aboriginal people throughout the 1500s.

The first [[France|French]] explorer to reach Quebec was [[Jacques Cartier]]. He sailed into the St. Lawrence River in 1534 and established a [[colony]] near present-day Quebec City.

[[Samuel de Champlain]] came from France and traveled into the St. Lawrence River. In 1608, he founded Quebec City as a permanent fur trading outpost. Champlain signed trading and military agreements with the Aboriginal people. Voyageurs, coureurs des bois, and [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] used river [[canoe|canoes]] to explore the interior of the North American continent. 

After 1627, [[Louis XIII of France|King Louis XIII of France]] made a rule that only [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]] could go to live in New France. [[Jesuit]] [[cleric|clerics]] tried to [[Religious conversion|convert]] New France's Aboriginal people to Catholicism. New France became a Royal Province of France in 1663. The [[population]] grew from about 3,000 to 60,000 people between 1666 and 1760. Colonists built farms on the banks of St. Lawrence River.

In 1753 France began building a series of forts in the British [[Ohio]] Country. Britain asked the French to remove the forts, and the French refused. By 1756, France and Britain were at war. In 1758, the British attacked New France by sea and captured the French fort at Louisbourg.

In 1759, British General James Wolfe defeated General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm outside Quebec City. France gave its North American land to Great Britain in 1763. In 1764, New France was renamed the Province of Quebec.

In 1774, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] passed the Quebec Act, giving recognition to French law, [[Roman Catholicism in Canada|Catholic religion]], and French language in the colony. The Quebec Act gave the Quebec people their first Charter of [[rights]]. The Quebec Act made American colonists angry, so they launched the [[American Revolution]]. A 1775 [[invasion]] by the [[Continental Army|American Continental Army]] was stopped at Quebec City. In 1783, Quebec gave the territory south of the [[Great Lakes]] to the new United States of America. In 1867 the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the British North America Act, which brought most of the provinces together.

== Quiet Revolution ==
The [[conservative]] government of Maurice Duplessis dominated Quebec [[politics]] from 1944 to 1960 with the support of the Catholic Church. The Quiet Revolution was a period of social and political change. During the Quiet Revolution, English Canadians lost their control over the Quebec [[economy]], the Roman Catholic Church became less important, and the Quebec government took over the [[Hydroelectricity|hydro-electric]] companies.

In 1963, a [[terrorist]] group that became known as the Front de Libération du Québec (FLQ) began doing [[Bombing|bombings]], [[Robbery|robberies]] and attacks on government offices. In 1970 the FLQ kidnapped [[James Cross]], the British trade commissioner to Canada. The FLQ also [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] and [[assassination|assassinated]] [[Pierre Laporte]], Minister of Labour and Deputy Premier of Québec. Laporte's body was found in the trunk of [[Paul Rose]]'s car, on the South Shore of Montreal on October 17 1970. [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] Pierre Trudeau invoked the War Measures Act, and 497 people were arrested.

The Quiet Revolution was so named because it was not marked by [[protest|protests]] or violence.

In 1977, the newly elected [[Parti Québécois]] government of [[René Lévesque]] introduced the Charter of the French Language. Often known as Bill 101, it defined French as the only official language of Quebec. 

==Government==
The government is based in the provincial capital, [[Quebec City]]. The government is led by a lieutenant-governor (pronounced "lef-") who represents the Crown. As of 2014, he is [[Pierre Duchesne]]. The political leader of the province is the premier. He is [[Philippe Couillard]] of the Quebec Liberal Party (PLQ), elected in 2014.

'''Reading''' is a way of getting [[information]] from something that is [[writing|written]]. Reading involves recognising the [[symbol]]s that make up a [[language]]. Reading and [[hearing]] are the two most common ways to get information. Information gained from reading can include [[entertainment]], especially when reading [[fiction]] or [[humor]].

Reading by people is mostly done from [[paper]]. Stone, or chalk on a [[blackboard]], or ink on a [[whiteboard]] can also be read. [[Computer]] displays can be read.

Reading can be something that someone does by themself or they can read aloud. This could be done to benefit other listeners. It could also be done to help concentrate.

''Proofreading'' is a kind of reading that is done to find mistakes in a piece of writing.

[[Category:Learning]]{{Religion}}
A '''religion''' is a set of [[belief]]s that is held by a group of people. There are many different religions, each with a different set of beliefs. The beliefs are about the world and the people in it, about how they came into being, and what their purpose is. These beliefs are often linked to [[supernatural]] beings such as [[God]], a number of [[Deity|gods]] or [[spirit]]s. They may also be linked to an idea such as a path that the spirit of each person should take towards goodness, truth and duty. This is called [[spirituality]]. Each religion has different ideas about these things. Each religion also has a "[[moral]] code" which is a set of beliefs about how humans should act. Each religion usually has their own type of "devotions" when people worship or pray. They often have [[ritual]]s (special things that are always done in the same way) for certain times of the year or certain times of a person's life.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/religion Reference Dictionary- Religion]</ref> Other words that are used for religion are "faith" and "belief system".<ref>The words "belief system" may not necessarily refer to a religion, though a religion may be referred to as "belief system."</ref> Altogether, followers of religion can be known as ''religionists''. Some people follow more than one religion at a time.

The largest religions are [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Judaism]]. There are many [[List of religions|other religions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html|title=Major Religions by adherents}}</ref> People who do not believe in any gods are called [[atheism|atheists]].

== Religious beliefs ==
=== God ===
[[File:Brahma Musée Guimet 25971.jpg|thumb|upright|A statue of the Hindu deity [[Brahma]].]]

In many religions, one of the main beliefs is that there is a "deity" (or [[Deity|god]]) who is a great [[Creation myth|creator]] spirit. In many religions, there is just [[Monotheism|one deity]] that the people believe in. In other religions, there are [[Polytheism|many deities]] who each have different roles in the [[universe]]. In many religions, there are other types of spirits. These may include [[angel]]s, [[devil]]s and other such things which can be both good and bad.

Giving honour to God, the gods or the spirits is an important part of most religions. While this may often be done privately, it is also often done with gatherings of people and [[ritual]]s. These rituals are often based on old [[tradition]]s, and may have been done in almost the same way for hundreds, or even thousands of years.

=== Human spirit ===
Another main belief is that humans have a "soul" or spirit which lives on after their body has died. The person's spirit is on a journey through life that continues after death. Most religions believe that what a person does during their lifetime will affect what happens to their spirit in the [[afterlife]]. Many religions teach that a good person's spirit can reach a special place of peace and happiness such as [[Heaven]] or [[Nirvana]], and that a bad person's spirit can travel to a place of pain and suffering such as [[Hell]]. Still other religions believe in [[reincarnation]] - that instead of going either to Heaven or Hell, spirits of the dead return to earth in a new body.

=== Morality ===
"Morals" are the way a human behaves to other humans. Most religions make rules about human morals. The rules of how people should act to each other are different in different religions.

For some religions, following a "path" of goodness, truth and duty is very important. This is called [[Tao]] in China. In the teachings of [[Judaism]], people were told to "love your neighbour as yourself". In the teachings of [[Jesus]], people were told to think of every single person as their "neighbour" and treat them with love.

Not every religion teaches people to be kind to all other people. In many religions, it has been common for people to believe that they have to act kindly only to some people and not to others. In some religions, people believed that they could please a god by killing or [[human sacrifice|sacrificing]] another person.

== Traditions ==
[[File:Shane Claiborne OCP.jpg|thumb|The man on the left is teaching others about his religion]]
=== Teaching ===
A religion is passed on from one person to another through teachings and stories (which are often called "myths") which may be written down like the [[Bible]], or [[Oral tradition|told from memory]] like the [[Dreaming (spirituality)|Dreamtime]] stories of [[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aboriginal]] people. In many religions, there are people who take the role of "priest" and spend their lives teaching others about the religion. There are also people who take the role of "pastor" and spend their life caring for other people. A person may be both a priest and a pastor. They are called by different names in different religions.

=== Symbols ===
[[Symbol]]s are used to remind people of their religious beliefs. They are also used or worn as a sign to other people that the person belongs to a particular religion. A symbol might be something that is drawn or written, it might be a piece of clothing or jewellery, it might be a sign that a person makes with their body, or it might be a building or monument or artwork. Picture symbols for different religions are shown in the box in the introduction to this article.

=== Witness and conversion ===
In many religions, it is thought important that people should show other people that they are following a particular religion. This might be done in a general way by wearing a symbol or a type of clothing. Many people believe that it is important to tell other people about their religion, so that they can believe as well. This is called "witnessing". 
[[File:Sikhs on the move!.jpg|thumb|left|These Sikhs in Canada wear a head-dress of turban or head scarf as a symbol and witness to their religion.]]
There are many ways to witness. A young person might simply say to their friends "I do not use drugs or get drunk because of my religion". This is a witness. A person may tell their classmates, workmates and friends about their beliefs. A person might go to other people's houses and talk about their beliefs, or invite the people to join in the rituals of the religion, such as going to church or to a religious festival. A person might have printed material such as books or leaflets that they give to other people to read. A person might travel to a different country to teach, to work in a health service or to help people in some other way. (People who do this are called "missionaries".) These are different ways that people witness to their religion.

When a person hears a witness and decides that they will join the religion, this is called a "conversion". Usually a person decides to join a religion because they like what they have read or been told, and they believe that they are hearing the truth. They join the religion because they choose. However, throughout history there have been many times when people have been forced to join a religion by violence and threats. This is still happening today.

In most countries of the world, people are free to belong to whatever religion they choose. This is generally thought of as a basic [[Human rights|human right]]. However, there are parts of the world where it is illegal (against the law) to witness to any religion except the one accepted by the government of the country. People who belong to other religions may be threatened, put in jail or murdered.

[[File:Muslim man at prayer.jpg|thumb|upright|A Muslim man at prayer. Prayer is an important ritual for many religious people.]]

=== Ritual ===
[[Ritual]]s are an important part of the tradition of many religions. In many religions, it is the tradition for people to meet for a celebration on one day in every week. There are also major celebrations that may be held only at certain times of the year, for example, on the birthday of a person who is honoured in that religion. Some religions have celebrations for different seasons of the year, or when the sun or moon is in a certain part of the sky.

In nearly every religion, the important stages of a person's life have a religious celebration. Birth, naming, reaching an age to think for oneself, reaching adulthood, marriage, childbirth, sickness and death are all celebrated by some religions. Having a celebration or special traditions when a person dies is very common.

It is the traditions that are about death that give the earliest evidence of religious beliefs. Scientists have discovered that 120,000 years ago, [[Neanderthal]] people started burying their dead. Early [[Homo sapiens]] put tools and other things into graves with the bodies, as if they could use them in the afterlife. From 40,000 years ago, many of the objects in graves are small artworks. Scientists believe that these objects were put there for religious reasons.

[[File:Dalai Lama and Bishop Tutu. Carey Linde.jpg|thumb|left|Leaders in two religious institutions, the Dalai Lama (Buddhist) and Archbishop Desmond Tutu ([[Anglican Church|Anglican]])]]

=== Groups and institutions ===
An [[institution]] is one name for an organization. Many religions have organizations that manage the way that people who follow the religion are to act. The organization might [[employment|employ]] religious leaders, [[education|educate]] people into the ideas of the religion, manage money, own buildings and make rules. Many religions have sub-groups which are called [[denomination]]s. In Islam, for example, there is [[Ahmadiyya]], [[Sunnism]], [[Shi'ism]] and [[Sufism]].

=== Buildings ===
[[File:Psalms WesternWall.jpg|thumb|A Jewish man reads the Psalms of David at the Western Wall, [[Jerusalem]]]]

Most religions have special buildings where people meet. They are often called [[temple]]s. In [[Judaism]], they are called [[synagogue]]s. In [[Christianity]], they are called [[church]]es. In [[Islam]], they are called [[mosque]]s. In [[Buddhism]] there are [[pagoda]]s, temples and monastries. People often try to make their religious building as beautiful as possible. Some religious buildings are great works of [[architecture]].

=== Art and music ===
People often make artworks that are about their religion, or that are used in religious celebration, or are put in a religious building. Religious art comes in all shapes and sizes, from tiny pieces of jewellery to huge statues and paintings. Artworks often give important clues to [[historian]]s about different ancient religions that are not well understood.

Music is often important in religious celebrations. Singing, chanting and playing musical instruments are often part of regular religious gatherings of people. Special music is often used on special occasions. Many famous composers have written religious music. The words of songs that are 3,000 years old are used every day in Christian churches and Jewish synagogues.

[[Food]]s are '''raw''' when they are not [[cook]]ed. 
Most things are good to eat raw, but some can be poisonous.   

==Health==

There's currently no solid evidence to suggest that raw food is more healthy than cooked food.

===Germs===

Raw food can sometimes make people sick because of bacteria which would otherwise be destroyed by cooking.

{{disambig}}[[File:Map of the Roman Empire at its height.svg|thumb|250px|Greatest size of the Roman Empire, in about 117 [[AD]]]]
[[File:Roman Republic Empire map.gif|thumb|200px|The Roman Empire at different times.]]

The '''Roman Empire''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''imperium romanum'') was the largest [[empire ]] of the ancient world. Its capital was [[Rome]], and its empire was based on the [[Mediterranean]]. The Empire dates from 27 BC, when [[Octavian]] became the Emperor, Augustus.

The empire was the third stage of [[Ancient Rome]]. [[Rome]] was first ruled by [[Roman Kingdom|Roman kings]], then by the [[Roman Republic]], then by an emperor.

Many modern lands were once part of the Roman Empire, including [[Roman Britain|Britain]] (not [[Scotland]]), [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Gaul|France]], [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], [[Germany]], [[Egypt]], and the north coast of [[Africa]]. The main language of the Roman Empire was [[Latin]]; [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] was an important secondary language.

The western part of the Roman Empire continued for about 500 years, and the eastern part, including [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]], continued for about a thousand years more. The eastern part was called the [[Byzantine Empire]] with a capital at [[Constantinople]].

== Governing the Empire ==
In order to control their large empire, the Romans developed important ideas about [[law]] and [[government]]. They developed the best army in the world at that time, and ruled by force. They had fine [[engineering]], and built roads, cities, and outstanding buildings. The Empire was divided into [[province]]s, each with a governor plus [[wikt:civil|civil]] and [[military]] support. [[Letter]]s, both official and private, would constantly go to and from Rome.

[[Trade]] was most important for Rome, a city of more than a million people, by far the largest city in the world. They needed, and got, [[wheat]] from Egypt, [[tin]] from Britannia, [[grape]]s from [[Gaul]], and so on. In return, the Romans built provincial capitals into fine cities, protected them from raids by [[barbarian]]s, and provided education and career opportunities for young people in the provinces, such as careers in the [[Roman army]].

In principle, emperors had absolute control, and could do as they pleased. In practice, they faced many difficult problems. They had a staff of what we call '[[Civil service|civil servants]]' and the advice of the [[Roman Senate]]. The emperor had to decide what were the most important issues facing the Empire, and what should be done about them. Most of them tried to do two sorts of thing. One was to do things to improve the life of Romans in peacetime. The other was to fight and defeat Rome's enemies. A wealthy empire always has enemies.

With kings and emperors, a big problem is the [[order of succession]]. Who follows them when they die? Kings were sometimes followed by their eldest son, if he was capable of ruling. For Roman emperors, more often it would be an [[Adoption|adopted]] son. It worked like this. The emperor would notice an outstanding young man from one of the best families. He would adopt him as his son<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption_in_ancient_Rome|title=Adoption in ancient Rome|first=|last=|date=|website=Wikipedia|publisher=|accessdate=7/26/2016}}</ref>. Before he died he would make clear whom he thought should succeed him, by making him a [[Roman consul]], or by stating in his [[Will (law)|will]] that the younger man should succeed him. Sometimes this worked; sometimes it did not. Every now and then there would be a [[civil war]] between claimants to the throne.

An adopted son or two gave the emperor more choices. Some emperors had no son; some had sons who were killed in battle, or died during a [[plague]]. Later on, emperors grew so weak that the [[Roman army]] would just pick one of their [[General officer|generals]] to be the next emperor. This often led to [[civil war]]. The life stories of the emperors can be found in [[List of Roman emperors]].

The Romans fought many wars against other countries, and enjoyed watching violent [[sports]]. They enjoyed watching races between [[chariot]]s pulled by [[horse]]s, and fights between men using [[weapon]]s ([[gladiator]]s). Unlike in modern [[sport]]s, the fighters were often killed in these fights. Romans enjoyed these shows in the [[Colosseum]].

The Romans had great [[civil engineering]]. They built many large public buildings and [[wikt:villa|villa]]s, [[aqueduct]]s to carry [[water]], and good [[stone]] [[bridge]]s and [[road]]s. Some of these things can still be seen today. Many famous [[writer]]s were Romans, including [[Cicero]] and [[Virgil]].

The [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]] tells about the Romans in the life of [[Jesus Christ]]. During Jesus' life, the Romans, who were [[pagan]]s, ruled his country. Later, several emperors tried to [[History of Christianity#Persecutions|destroy Christianity]] but they did not succeed. By 312 AD the emperor [[Galerius]] allowed people freedom to follow [[Christianity]], and the next year, a [[General officer|general]], [[Constantine I (Rome)|Constantine]], became emperor and converted to Christianity.

The [[city]] of [[Rome]] was taken over several times by [[barbarian]]s, notably in 410 AD when the [[Goth]]s sacked the city ([[looting]]). The last Western Roman emperor, [[Romulus Augustus]], resigned in 476 AD. The Roman Empire would last another 1,000 years as the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the east.

The main [[coin]] of the Roman Empire was the [[denarius]].

[[Category:Ancient Rome| ]]
[[Category:Empires]]A '''regime''' is the [[leader]] and other people who run a [[government]] of a [[sovereign state]].

There are many kinds of regimes.  They can achieve [[Influence|power]] in many ways.  Depending on the time and place and local [[civics]] like the [[electoral system]], they can lose power in many ways too.  The most common way for a regime to lose power was a [[coup]], [[invasion]] or [[revolution]] until the [[20th century]].  After that it became very dangerous and difficult to use these methods.  Peaceful regime change is usually by an [[election]] - this method is now used by more than half the people on the [[Earth]].  It is called [[representative democracy]].  Such regimes are often called '''administration'''s to make it clear they are not [[dictator]]s, and since the [[executive branch]] does not have all the power itself - it may share it with a [[legislative branch]].  Also the [[judicial branch]] is separate.  The [[court]]s are not usually considered part of the regime.

However, some things are the same no matter how the regime achieved power:

*The regime needs help among people outside the regime and government to stay in power - these may be in the [[military]] or a [[political party]].
*Military and [[police]] obey the regime's orders, and can kill people.  If they would not do so, then, it would be possible to change regimes by force.
*[[Trade]] and [[tax]] is set by the regime, which can take [[money]] away.
*The regime speaks for the whole country when dealing with other countries.

When many regimes negotiate at the [[United Nations]] or [[World Trade Organization]], it does not matter at all how each regime got its power.  It matters only that they can agree and make everyone in their country do as the agreement says.

When someone wants a regime to change in another country, they usually are not able to do this by any means other than violence or interfering in its [[election]].  This is common if a regime is threatened by another regime.

[[Category:Forms of government]][[File:River Thames - Isle of Dogs to Thurrock.jpg|thumb|300px|The River [[Thames]] in London, England. People have lived along the banks of this river for thousands of years.]]

A '''river''' is a [[stream]] of [[water]] that flows through a channel (or passage) in the surface of the ground. The passage where the river flows is called the river bed and the earth on each side is called a river bank. A river begins on high ground or in hills or mountains and flows down from the high ground to the lower ground, because of [[gravity]]. A river begins as a small stream, and gets bigger the farther it flows. 

The water in a river is called [[fresh water]]. It comes from rain or snow and it can usually be drunk safely, unless it has been [[pollution|polluted]]. The water in a [[sea]] cannot be drunk safely because it is [[salt water]]. Both people and animals often live near rivers. They need water to survive and, for humans, rivers were once the only means of fast [[transport]].

== About rivers ==
=== The beginning of a river ===
The start of a river is called the ''source'' or ''head water''. The part of the river that is near the source is called a 'young' river.<ref name=camilla>{{cite book | last = | first =  | title = Earth Science| publisher =  Austin, [[Texas]]: Holt, Rinehart and Winston| date = 2001|  isbn = 0-03-055667-8}}</ref> A young river is often in a V-shaped river bed, and flows quickly downhill over stones, and around big rocks. Young rivers often have lots of small [[waterfall]]s and [[rapids]]. 

* The source of a river may be a [[spring (water)|spring]], often on a [[hill]], [[mountain]], glacier, or another high place. A spring is water that flows out from under the ground.
* The source of a river may be a lake where lots of water from small streams gathers when it rains or snows.
* A river may begin in mountains where there is snow. The melting snow runs together to form a small stream that runs down the mountain. As more little streams run in, the main stream gets bigger, until it forms a river.
* Some rivers flow from hills where there is no snow, but lots of rain.
* Some rivers only flow after there has been rain near the head water.

=== The middle part of a river ===
The middle part of a river is called a mature river. A mature river makes a riverbed that is U-shaped. It might be very deep and run fast. It sweeps over small rocks and boulders, and makes big turns around hills and mountains. It is much wider than a young river, but not as wide as an old river. To cross over a mature river, people use bridges. Many cities and towns are built on the banks of mature rivers. Many farms that keep animals such as [[cattle|dairy cows]], [[horse]]s and [[sheep]] are along mature rivers because the animals can drink from the river every day.

Image:Bacharach rheinblick.jpg|The Rhine River valley has many towns. 
Image:Firenze-riflessi sull'arno2.jpg|The city of [[Florence]] was built beside the Arno River. 
</gallery>

=== The last part of a river ===
A river usually ends by flowing into an [[ocean]], a [[lake]] or a bigger river. The place where the river flows out into a bigger body of water is called the 'mouth' of the river. 

As a river flows towards its mouth, the countryside around the river often changes from hilly to flat. As it flows over the flat land the river becomes wider and slower. A wide slow river is called an 'old river'. An old river often floods across the land after there is lots of rain at the headwaters. An old river slowly builds up its banks on either side; the high banks are called [[levee]]s. An old river often [[meanders]] (twists and turns), and sometimes, after a flood, it leaves lakes behind which are called ox-bows or [[Billabong (lake)|billabongs]]. Old rivers are the most useful type of river for growing [[crop]]s. [[Corn]], [[rice]], [[fruit]], [[cotton]], [[hay]], [[tobacco]] and [[sugar]] are some of the crops that are grown near old rivers. 

The shape of the mouth depends on the conditions of the sea where it flows. If there is a strong [[tide]] where the river meets the sea, the river forms an [[estuary]]. An estuary is a wide, funnel-like mouth of the river. The fresh water of the river mixes slowly with the salt water, becoming [[brackish]] water – somewhat salty water. Many kinds of [[fish]], [[clam]]s, [[mollusc]]s and other sealife live at estuaries. Many of the world's largest [[city|cities]] and [[harbour]]s are at estuaries.

Where a river flows out to the sea, it sometimes flows very slowly through sandy or muddy land, making lots of little islands as it flows. The main stream of the river gets broken into many parts that spread out into a triangle shape like the Greek letter [[delta]]. When this happens, it is called the [[river delta|delta]] of the river. Deltas are often places that are not good for towns or farms but are very good for birds and other wildlife and [[fishing]]. Deltas are often made into [[wildlife reserve]]s. Not all rivers have deltas. There are famous deltas on the [[Nile River]], the [[Amazon River]], the [[Mekong River]], the [[Mississippi River]] and the [[Danube River]].

=== Underground rivers ===
Some rivers flow underground through [[cave]]s. Underground rivers form in places where there are lots of cracks in the rocks above, so that in rainy weather, the water runs downs and collects in small underground streams. Sometimes the underground water trickles or gushes out of the ground to form a small [[spring (water)|spring]] of water. In other places, where there are caves, the small underground streams run together to form a river. The river can sometimes run through deep wide underground caverns. While many underground rivers flow gently, some underground rivers flow fast and have [[rapids]], particularly after heavy rain. Many underground rivers flow out through a cave mouth to become an ordinary river.

== Using rivers ==
The water in rivers is "fresh water" that has come from rain, snow and from underground streams. It can usually be drunk safely by people unless it is too dirty because of mud or human [[pollution]]. People and animals need fresh water to drink, so they often live by the side of a river. 

* Rivers give water for drinking, bathing and washing clothes.
* Rivers give water for [[cattle]] and other animals to drink and for people to grow plants.
* Rivers give [[Product (consumer goods)|products]] that are useful to people such as fish for food, [[clay]] for bricks and [[Reed (plant)|reeds]] to make the roofs of houses.
* Rivers can be used for transporting people, crops and other goods by boat.
* Rivers can be used to give power to turn machinery such as water [[watermill|mills]].
* Rivers give water for factories that make cloth, steel and many other products.
* Rivers sometimes have dams to hold the water for people to drink, or to make electricity.
* Rivers can be used for [[leisure]] and [[sport]]s such as swimming, boating, fishing and just walking by the river.
* Rivers often have beautiful scenery. Many painters, story-tellers and poets have painted or written about rivers.
* Rivers are sometimes turned into canals.

== Important rivers ==

* the [[Amazon River]] in [[South America]] is a very wide tropical river flowing through the Amazon [[Jungle]] and into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] through a large delta. Many types of fish live in it. It is the largest river in the world.
* the [[Nile River]] in [[Africa]]. For thousands of years this river has provided the people of [[Egypt]] with water to help their food grow. [[Cairo]], the biggest [[city]] in [[Egypt]] and [[Africa]], is built near the Nile's [[river delta|delta]] on the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It is the longest river in the world.
* the [[Mississippi River]] in the [[United States]]. Many crops are grown along the sides of the Mississippi. It was also used for transport. The Mississippi flows through the [[state]]s of [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Iowa]], [[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], [[Arkansas]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Louisiana]].

=== River Terminology ===
*A '''meander''' is a bend or curve in a river.
*The '''mouth''' of a river is where the river enters the sea, ocean or lake.
*An '''oxbow''' lake is located at the side of a river and is curved like a "meander"
*A [[braided river]] is a usually slow-moving river which splits up and joins together repeatedly.

== Other types of rivers ==
* A '''submarine river''' is a stream of water that flows along under the surface of an [[ocean]]. One of them, named the [[Cromwell current]], was found in [[1952]]. ("Sub marine" comes from [[Latin language|Latin]] and means "under sea".) 
* A '''subterranean river''' is a river which flows under the surface of the [[earth]]. One of them was found in [[August]] [[1958]] under the [[Nile River]]. (The term "sub terranean" also comes from Latin and means "under ground".)

[[Category:Angles]]A '''reward''' is getting something good for doing a given task.  It needs someone who has the power to give the good thing. It is the opposite of [[punishment]].

Ideas like [[risk and reward]], [[reward and punishment]] are based on the idea that people do things, or avoid doing things, to get rewards. In [[psychology]] there is another idea that this is not true. This other idea says that training ([[conditioning]]) and emotions ([[affective factor]]s) are much more important than the rewards or punishments given by others.

In trying to catch criminals and other bad people, the [[government]] often offers money to people. This money is given to people who may capture the criminal, or give information that helps the police catch them. For example after the [[Eureka Stockade]] [[rebellion]] in [[Ballarat, Victoria]] in 1854, the government offered a big reward of 400 pounds for the capture of the people who had started it.
[[Image:Reward notice lalor black eureka.JPG|thumb|250px|right|A reward poster from [[Ballarat, Victoria]]]]
In 2001, the US government offered a big reward of 2.5 million dollars for help in capturing the person who had sent [[Anthrax (disease)|anthrax]] in letters to a newspaper [[journalist]] and 2 [[senator]]s. Anthrax is a [[disease]] which can kill people.

A '''ranch''' is a [[large]] [[farm]] where [[animal]]s such as [[cow]]s, [[horse]]s or [[sheep]] are raised. The word ''ranch'' is from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word "rancho". It is used in [[American English|American]] and [[Canadian English]].

A ranch is often on private [[land]]. Ranches are often found in the [[desert]] areas of the western [[United States]] because there is plenty of available space. There are also many in [[Australia]], where they are called [[Station (agriculture)|stations]].
There are lots of positives and negatives to cattle ranching including food and equipment for the locals.

== History ==
  [[File:Bantam-jeep-no-watermark.jpg|thumb|right|200px|{{Center|A Bantam Jeep during Army testing}}]]
SUVs come from designs that were originally [[military]]. SUVs are [[Descendant|descended]] from the [[World War II]] 1/4 ton [[reconnaissance]] vehicle, better known as the Jeep.<ref name=Notman1>Robert Notman, ''Bantam, Ford and Willys-1/4-Ton Reconnaissance Cars'' (Tallahassee, FL: Robert V. Notman, 2006), p. 1</ref> The first Jeep was built by the [[American Austin Car Company|American Bantam Car Company]].<ref name=Notman1/> Because Bantam was too small to [[Manufacturing|manufacture]] all the vehicles needed for the [[United States Army|army]], [[Willys]]-Overland and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] were given the army [[contract]]s.<ref>John Gunnell, ''Standard Catalog of Light-Duty Ford Trucks 1905-2002'' (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, 2003), p. 73</ref> The Willys vehicle was designated [[Willys MB]] while the Ford vehicles were called [[Ford GPW]]. There was very little difference between the two and both were made from 1941 to 1945. They were the most widely produced military vehicle during World War II. American soldiers loved their Jeeps and many wanted to buy one when they returned home. Willys began producing a civilian model called the [[Jeep CJ]] immediately after the war. These were built from 1946 to 1986.<ref>Jim Allen, ''Jeep Collector's Library'' (St. Paul, MN: Motorbooks International, 2004), p. 12</ref>

In 1948 British Rover Car Company ([[Land Rover]]) built its first vehicle for rural terrain based on a war surplus Jeep frame.<ref name=Slaton285>Hunter R Slaton; et al., ''Vault Guide to the Top Manufacturing Employers'' (New York: Vault, Inc., 2006), p. 285</ref> It had an all-[[aluminum]] body and could be [[wikt:repair|repair]]ed in the field. [[British]] [[police]] forces, the military and other services found them ideal for off-road and as [[Manor house|estate]] vehicles.<ref name=Slaton285/> In 1970 the [[Range Rover]] line was launched and became the [[wikt:luxury|luxury]] SUV vehicles they are today.<ref>Ralph Hosier, ''Land Rover Discovery, Defender & Range Rover: How to Modify for High Performance & Serious Off-Road Action'' (Dorchester, Dorset, England: Veloce Publishing, 2011), p. 10</ref>
  [[File:Bronco.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|{{Center|Early Ford Bronco}}]]
In the 1960s Ford introduced the [[Ford Bronco]].<ref name=Garrett1251>''Encyclopedia of Transportation: Social Science and Policy'', ed. Mark Garrett (Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc., 2014), p. 1251</ref> [[International Harvester]] Company introduced the [[International Harvester Scout]] and [[Chevrolet]] brought out the [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|K5 Blazer]].<ref name=Garrett1251/> Pickup trucks and SUVs combined only sold about 20% of all vehicles in the US in 1965. The rising gas prices and dependence on foreign oil triggered Congress to pass the first [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) standards in 1975. The law required car manufacturers to double fuel economy in the next ten years.<ref name=Garrett1251/> But light trucks (including SUVs) were given lower standards by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA).

The 1980s saw smaller lighter SUVs such as the [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer]], the [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)]] and the [[Ford Bronco II]].<ref name=Garrett1251/> They were compact SUVs powered by smaller, more fuel efficient engines. The SUVs of the 1980s attracted a different kind of buyer. They wanted to be seen as a rugged, [[wikt:masculine|masculine]], [[wikt:outdoors|outdoors]]-type. But less than 10 percent of users during this period actually drove off road.<ref name=Garrett1251/> By the mid-1980s concerns were rising over SUV safety. The [[CBS News]] program [[60 Minutes]] showed footage of a Jeep CJ rolling over. Other tests showed the Ford Bronco II could tip onto two wheels in turns as slow as {{convert|20|mph}}.<ref name=Garrett1251/>

Safety concerns continued through the 1990s. In May 2000, the (NHTSA) contacted [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]]. There was a high incidence of [[tire]] failure on [[Ford Explorer]]s, [[Mercury Mountaineer]]s, and [[Mazda Navajo]]s fitted with Firestone tires. There were Accidents involving Firestone-equipped Explorers resulting in at least 174 deaths and more than 700 injuries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,128198,00.html |title=Inside the Ford/Firestone Fight |author=John Greenwald |date=29 May 2001 |website= |publisher= Time Inc. |accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> Ford blamed Firestone and Firestone blamed Ford.

They were smaller, lighter and could share engines and chassis designs with existing models. The [[Lexus RX]] and the [[BMW X5]] followed along with other models.<ref name=Garrett1253/> In 2006 Ford changed to a unibody CUV chassis for its [[Ford Explorer]] vehicle. By then CUV sales made up half of the overall SUV market.<ref name=Garrett1253/> By 2012 CUV sales were higher than SUV sales.<ref name=Garrett1253/> While CUVs are not designed for off road use like an SUV, they are still very popular.

== Off-roading sports ==
   [[File:Range Rover Camel Trophy in Kraków (1).jpg|thumb|right|220px|{{Center|Camel Trophy Land Rover}}]]
There are many forms of off-roading which are centered around SUVs. 
* '''[[Rockcrawling]]''' is a popular off-road sport. Vehicles used for rock crawling are usually modified with different [[tires]], suspension and gear ratios. Rock crawling takes time to learn and can be very expensive. Most rock crawlers have full-time jobs and many get sponsors to help with the costs.<ref>Patrick Hueller, ''Rock Crawling: Tearing It Up'' (Minneapolis: Lerner Publications Company, 2014), pp. 24–25</ref> The object is to get the vehicle across difficult to near-impossible rocks and terrain without completely destroying the vehicle.
* The '''[[Camel Trophy]]''' competition (1981–2000) was an annual 4x4 competition. The first Camel trophy was held on the [[Trans-Amazonian Highway]], a {{convert|4,000|km}} road across [[Brazil]]. Over the next eight years, the expeditions crossed [[Sumatra]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Zaire]], Brazil, [[Borneo]], [[Australia]], [[Madagascar]] and [[Sulawesi]] before returning to the Amazon. After the first year the endurance event came to be dominated by specially equipped Land Rover vehicles. The Camel Trophy Owners Club is a group of people who collect ex-Camel Trophy vehicles.   
* '''Jeep Jamborees''' have been held since 1953.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fourwheeler.com/events/1501-2014-big-bear-jeep-jamboree/ |title=2014 BIG BEAR JEEP JAMBOREE |author=Bob Carpenter |date=25 November 2014 |website= |publisher=Fourwheeler Network |accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> Jeep Jamborees are off-road excursions that travel historic and scenic trails across the US.

== Popularity ==
  [[File:Land Rover at the 2013 Dubai Motor Show (10816705076).jpg|thumb|right|220px|{{Center|Range Rover "Autobiography Black Edition"}}]]
There are many reasons why SUVs have become popular. One reason is the comfort of their large cabins. Many models can carry almost as much as a minivan. Another reason is the driver still sits higher than other cars and SUVs with truck frames can be among the heavier vehicles on the highway. Their size gives them an image of safety.<ref>Keith Bradsher, ''High and Mighty: The Dangerous Rise of the SUV'' (New York: Public Affairs, 2003), p. xiii</ref> Men aren't the only targets of SUV and CUV ads. For example, some [[Advertising|ads]] for the [[Subaru Forester]] are deliberately aimed at women buyers.<ref>Jack Solomon, ''Signs of Life in the USA: Readings on Popular Culture for Writers'' (Boston, MA: Bedford/St. Martins, 2012), p. 61</ref> Roughly 35 to 40 percent of SUV buyers are women.<ref>Deborah Clarke, ''Driving Women: Fiction and Automobile Culture in Twentieth-Century America'' (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2007), p. 103</ref> Ads commonly show SUVs driving across [[wikt:boulder|boulder]]s or perched on a [[Mountain|mountain peak]].<ref name=Kilbourne103>Jean Kilbourne, ''Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel'' (New York: Touchstone, 1999), p. 103</ref> Advertisers know that one important reason many people buy SUVs is image.<ref name=Kilbourne103/>

[[Category:Sport utility vehicles| ]]'''Substance''' [''sub'-stuns''] is the material, or ''[[matter]]'', of which something is made. '''Substances''' are physical things that can be seen, touched, or measured. They are made up of one or more [[element]]al parts. [[Iron]], [[aluminium]], [[water]] and [[air]] are examples of substances.
[[Image:Kochendes wasser02.jpg|thumb|right|[[Steam]] and [[liquid]] water are two different forms of the same chemical substance, water.]]

==Problems of definition==

The main problem of a clear definition of what the substance is that if, for example, to consider not just the [[universe]] (cosmos), being and non-being, and in general all, the question arises, what is the constant basic principle (attribute) is the basis of the substance, which generally consists of all (that is, matter, [[mind]], [[senses]], [[space]], [[soul]], and so on).

==History of the concept==

The Latin word substantia - a translation of the Greek word for the essence (ousia), and in Latin to describe the essence of using the word essentia. In ancient philosophy substance is treated as a substrate, the first principle of all things (for example, "water" of [[Thales]], the "fire" of [[Heraclitus]]). 

In modern times, the [[concept]] of substance is treated and spread widely. The first view is connected with an ontological understanding of substance as ultimate bases being ([[Francis Bacon]], [[Benedict Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]). Central category of [[metaphysics]] in philosophy substance is identified as with God and with nature and determined as the cause of itself (Latin causa sui). The main characteristics (attributes) of a substance from Benedict Spinoza are thinking and [[stretch]]. By analogy with the philosophy of Benedict Spinoza substance considered in the light of the concept of René Descartes and Leibniz. The first substance is a unity of subject and object, and the second - the same atoms are simple beings who lose their stretch, but receive attribute [[aspirations]] (Fr. appetition) and [[multiplicity]]. Thanks Leibniz substance begins to associate with matter.

The second point of view on the substance - an epistemological understanding of the concept, its [[capabilities]] and the need for scientific knowledge (John Locke, David Hume). Immanuel Kant believed that the law under which any change in the substance of events and the number of stored it in nature remains the same, can be attributed to the "analogies of experience." Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel defined substance as the [[integrity]] of changing, transient side of things, as a "major step in the development of the will." For Arthur Schopenhauer substance - matter for David Hume - a fiction, the coexistence properties.

'''September''' is the ninth [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], coming between [[August]] and [[October]]. It has 30 [[day]]s. Its name comes from the [[Latin]] word ''sept'' for "seven" (it was the seventh month of the year, before [[January]] and [[February]] were added to the beginning of the year.)

== The Month ==
[[File:September WPA poster.jpg|thumb|120px|right|A Works Progress Administration Poster, from [[1940]], for September]]
September begins on the same day of week as [[December]] every year, as each day in September and its equivalent in [[December]] are 91 [[day]]s (13 [[week]]s) apart. In no year does any other month end on the same day of the week as September, though in [[common year]]s, it ends on the same day of the week as [[December]] of the previous year. September starts and ens on the same day of the week as [[June]] of the following year, if that year is not a [[leap year]]. If the following year is a leap year, then September starts on the same day of the week as [[March]] and [[November]] of that particular year (September [[2011]] started on the same day of the week as [[March]] and [[November]] [[2012]], as an example).

In the old [[Roman calendar]], September was the [[seven]]th month, which is where it got its name ("Septem" means "seventh"). The ninth month at the time was [[November]] ("Novem" means "ninth"). With [[Julius Caesar]]'s [[calendar]] reform, September became the ninth month, with 30 days. September comes after [[August]] and before [[October]].

An [[equinox]] occurs in September, either on the [[September 22|22]]nd or [[September 23|23]]rd, meaning there are days and nights of about equal length, half way between the [[June]] and [[December]] [[solstice]]s. In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], [[Autumn]] (Fall) begins in this month, while in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], this is the beginning of [[Spring]]. For [[Meteorology|meteorologists]], the people who study the [[weather]], these seasons begin on [[September 1]] in those [[hemisphere]]s. In both hemispheres, it is the seasonal equivalent of [[March]] in the other. In most Northern Hemisphere countries, [[school]] starts in this month, following the [[summer]] holidays.

In [[Ancient Greece]], September was called ''Boedromion''. The [[Anglo-Saxons]] called it ''Gerstmonath'', meaning "[[Barley]] month", referring to the [[harvest]]. In other countries, it is referred to as ''Autumn Month'', such as in [[Finland]] (Syyskuu) and German-speaking parts of [[Switzerland]] (Herbstmonat).

[[Ethiopia]]n [[New Year]] occurs in September. [[Judaism|Jewish]] New Year also often occurs in this month.

:''Sound can also mean a body of [[water]], like a [[bay]] or [[Canal|channel]].''

We can define a sound wave as a disturbance which travels through some medium.
'''Sound''' is the term to describe what is [[hearing|heard]] when sound [[wave (physics)|waves]] pass through a [[Media|medium]] to the [[ear]]. All sounds are made by [[vibration]]s of molecules through which the sound travels. For instance, when a [[drum]] or a [[cymbal]] is struck, the object [[vibration|vibrates]]. These vibrations make [[air]] [[molecule]]s move. Sound waves move away from their source (where they came from), traveling on the [[air]] [[molecule]]s. When the vibrating air molecules reach our [[ear]]s, the [[eardrum]] vibrates, too. The bones of the ear vibrate in the same way that of the object that started the sound wave. These vibrations let you hear different sounds. Even [[music]] is vibrations. Irregular vibrations are [[noise]].

Sound waves are [[longitudinal wave]]s with two parts: ''[[compression]]'' and ''rarefaction''. Compression is the part of the sound waves where the molecules of air are pushed (''compressed'') together. Rarefaction is the part of the waves where the molecules are far away from each other. Sound waves are a [[sequence]] of compressions and rarefactions.

== The speed of sound ==
{{Main|Speed of sound}}
Sound waves can travel through [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s, and [[gas]]es, but it cannot travel through a [[vacuum]] (a place with nothing in it). This is why [[astronaut]]s can not talk to each other in space: they need a [[radio]] to hear each other. Sound can travel through water faster than through air; and they travel even faster in solids like [[stone]], [[iron]], and [[steel]]. Sound travels at 335 metres (1,100 feet) per second in the air.<ref name=whee>''The Earth and the Universe'' LIFEPAC Science, p. 33</ref>

== Pitch and Intensity ==

''Pitch'' is the highness or lowness of sound. [[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] is how humans hear different frequencies. Frequency is determined by the number of vibrations per second. The highest key on a [[piano]], for instance, vibrates 4,000 times per second. It has a frequency of 4000 hertz (Hz), or 4 kilohertz (kHz). Lower keys have lower frequencies. A note an [[octave]] higher than another note has twice the frequency of that note.<ref name=whee/> 

The intensity of a sound is how much sound energy goes through a square meter in one second. Sound waves with higher amplitude (bigger vibration) have higher intensity. The intensity of a sound is higher closer to the sound source. Farther away, it's less intense. The inverse square law shows how sound intensity becomes smaller, farther from the sound source. "Inverse square" says that when distance gets multiplied by a number, sound intensity gets divided by that number squared (the number times itself).<ref name=whee/> Thus, twice the distance means a quarter the intensity. 

Sound intensities can be very different. They can range from 0.000000000001, which are barely heard, to 1 W/m<sup>2</sup>  (painfully loud). The [[decibel]] scale makes sound intensity numbers easier to work with. A 0.000000000001 W/m<sup>2</sup> intensity is 0 dB (decibels). When the decibel number increases by 10, the intensity is ten times as much. So, a 1 W/m<sup>2</sup> intensity is 120 dB.

Loudness is how people sense the intensity of sound. Loudness depends on sound intensity, sound frequency, and the person's hearing.

=== Heard and not seen ===

Audible sound has [[frequency|frequencies]] between 20 [[Hertz|Hz]] to 20&nbsp;kHz. [[Human being]]s can hear audible sound. Sound waves with frequency above 20&nbsp;kHz are called [[ultrasound]] waves. Sound waves with frequency below 20&nbsp;Hz are called [[infrasound]] waves. Human beings cannot hear ultrasound waves and infrasound waves, but some animals, like [[bat]]s and [[dolphin]]s, use them. Older people have an even smaller hearing range. People are best at hearing sounds between 1000&nbsp;Hz and 6000&nbsp;Hz.

===The Doppler Effect===
When a sound source is moving towards someone, the frequency seems to increase. The same thing happens when someone moves toward the sound source. Frequency seems to decrease when someone moves away from a sound source. It also seems to decrease when the sound source moves away from someone. This is the [[Doppler effect]].

[[Category:Sound| ]]'''Society''' is the term to describe human beings together (collective, the sum of their [[social network]]s and [[power network]]s). It does not refer to everything everybody thinks or does, but only to those things that everybody acts upon – or refuses to do – quite reliably.

Because it must keep even the poorest and weakest members of a society willing to help even the richest and strongest, a society is very concerned with its [[citizenship]], [[rights]], [[ethics]] and [[time limit]]s. These are basic ways to achieve [[fairness]]. If they break down badly, people will think the society is unfair and start taking things from each other, refusing to help each other, or seeing those who have more as cheats.

While every society is different, the way it breaks down and fails is very often the same: [[fraud]], [[theft]], [[violence]], [[war]] and sometimes even [[genocide]] if people stop identifying with the society and thus identify with what they think of as a "race" of people. A new society may be formed out of only those who still agree, or who just survive the collapse of an old failed one.

If the strength and unity of any society's members' willingness to help each other is to be measured, it is called [[social capital]], because it substitutes for other forms of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. One needs less [[money]] with more [[solidarity]] in society, because the collective substitutes for the currency.

However, usually, the strength is not directly measured, but only assumed. People take [[risk]]s that society will support them, without knowing for sure that it will. For instance, they may refuse to obey the [[law]], and count on their fellow society members to free them in a [[jury]] or [[court of appeal]].

A [[social contract]] sets out rules for this kind of cooperation. One kind of social contract is a [[constitution]] – which allows for a jury or court to decide that the law, not the person, is wrong, according to the society's rules.

[[Category:Society| ]]A '''suggestion''' is an idea that one suggests, or says is [[goodness|good]] for [[another]] (or [[others]]) to [[follow]]. Some people may agree to it, and some may disagree. If they disagree or have a different suggestion, the person who first suggested the idea will usually discuss with the other people and find a good conclusion that satisfies both and is good.

[[Category:Basic English 850 words]]'''Spache Readability Formula''' is one method of finding out how hard a piece of [[write|writing]] is (its [[textual difficulty]]).

The method compares [[word]]s in a text to a list of words which are familiar in everyday writing. The words that are not on the list are called ''unfamiliar''. The [[number]] of words per sentence are counted. This number and the percentage of unfamiliar words is put into a [[formula]]. The result is a reading age. Someone of this age should be able to read the text.

Spache works best on texts that are for [[child]]ren under the age of eight.

the formula; (0.141 * average sentence length)+(0.086 * percentage of difficult words)+0.839 = grade level

According to Oleander Solutions ([http://www.oleandersolutions.com]), the revised Spache Formula is:

    GL = (.121 * ASL) + (.082 *UW) + .659 

Where:

    GL = U.S. grade level
    ASL = Average sentence length
    UW = Number of unique unfamiliar words

[[Category:Language]]A '''sport''' is commonly defined as an athletic activity or skill and involves a degree of [[competition]], such as [[baseball]], [[soccer]], [[bowling]], or [[basketball]].  Many people play sports with their friends. Sportsmen need [[Coach (sport)|coaches]] to teach or train [[team]]s or individuals how to do better. Sports can be played [[indoors]] or [[Position|outdoors]] and by individuals or teams.

Some people like to watch other people play sports. Those who watch others playing sports are called ''[[fanatic|fan]]s''. While some fans watch sports on [[television]], others actually go to [[stadium]]s or other places where people pay to watch them in person. These fans are called ''spectators''.

'''Science''' is what we do to find out about the natural world. It is the total of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geology]] and [[astronomy]]. Science makes use of [[mathematics]], and it makes [[observation]]s and [[experiment]]s. Science produces accurate [[facts]], scientific laws and [[theories]].<ref name=wilson>Wilson, Edward O. 1998.

[[Research]] uses the [[scientific method]]. Scientific research uses [[hypotheses]] based on ideas or earlier knowledge. Then those hypotheses are tested by [[experiments]].  

People who study and research science and try to find out everything about it are called [[scientist]]s. Scientists [[Research|study]] things by [[see|looking]] at them very carefully, by [[measure|measuring]] them, and by doing [[experiment]]s and [[test]]s. Scientists try to [[wikt:explain|explain]] why things [[act]] the way they do, and [[predict]] what will happen.

== Scientific method ==
Today, "science" usually refers to a way of pursuing [[knowledge]], not just the knowledge itself. It is mainly about the [[phenomena]] of the material world.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary</ref> In the 17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of ''[[scientific law|laws of nature]]'' such as [[Newton's laws of motion]]. And over the course of the 19th century, the word "science" became increasingly associated with the [[scientific method]] itself, as a way to study the natural world, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]] and [[biology]]. 

It is in the 19th century also that the term ''[[scientist]]'' was created by [[William Whewell]]. He meant it to distinguish those who sought knowledge on nature from those who sought other types of knowledge.<ref>The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' dates the origin of the word "scientist" to 1834.</ref>

The [[scientific method]] is the name given to the methods used by scientists to find knowledge. The main [[wikt:feature|feature]]s of the scientific method are:
#Scientists identify a question or a problem about nature. Some problems are simple, such as "how many legs do flies have?" and some are very deep, such as "why do objects fall to the ground?" 
#Next, scientists investigate the problem. They work at it, collecting facts. Sometimes all it takes is to look carefully. 
#Some questions cannot be answered directly. Then scientists suggest ideas, and test them out. They do [[experiment]]s and collect [[data]].
#Eventually, they figure out what they think is a good answer to the problem. Then they tell people about it.
#Later, other scientists may agree or not agree. They may suggest another answer. They may do more experiments. Anything in science might be revised if we find out the previous solution was not good enough.

== Other features of science ==
Not everyone completely agrees about how science works.  Some [[philosopher|philosophers]] and scientists say that scientific theories are only accepted for the time being. They last so long as they are the best explanation. When theories no longer explain the data, they are discarded and replaced. Or, sometimes scientists will make a theory better rather than discard it, or that they will keep on using the theory hoping that it will be made better eventually.
  
Science is a way to get [[knowledge]] by discarding what is not true. 
 
Scientists must be very careful to make explanations that fit well with what they [[Observation|observe]] and [[measure]].  They [[compete]] to provide better explanations.  An explanation might be [[wikt:interesting|interesting]] or [[wikt:pleasing|pleasing]], but if it does not [[agree]] with what other scientists really see and measure, they will try to find a better explanation.

Before a scientific article is [[wikt:publish|published]], other scientists read the article and decide whether the explanations make sense from the data.  This is called [[peer review]].  After articles are published, other scientists will also check if the same experiments, observations or tests produce the same data again.  [[Peer review]] and [[:wikt:repeating|repeating]] [[experiment]]s are the only way to be sure the [[knowledge]] is [[wikt:correct|correct]]. 

Science makes [[models of nature]], [[models of our universe]], and [[medicine]].  There are many different sciences with their own names.  However it is not right to say "science says" any one thing.  Science is a process, not just the [[fact]]s and [[rules]] believed at one time.

The '''Saint Lawrence River''' ({{lang-fr|fleuve Saint-Laurent}}; [[Tuscarora language|Tuscarora]]: ''Kahnawáʼkye'';<ref>Rudes, B. ''Tuscarora English Dictionary'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999</ref> [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]]: ''Kaniatarowanenneh'', meaning "big waterway") is a big [[river]] in eastern [[North America]]. It flows between the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[province]] of [[Ontario]] and the [[United States|American]] [[state]] of [[New York]], and through the Canadian province of [[Quebec]]. 

The river drains water from the [[Great Lakes]] into the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is more than three thousand [[kilometre]]s long. The river meets the Atlantic Ocean in a big "[[estuary]]" or bay, the biggest in the world; this is called the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]].

The Canadian cities of [[Kingston]], [[Montreal]], [[Trois-Rivières, Quebec|Trois-Rivières]] and [[Quebec City]] are on this river. It is very important because [[ship]]s can sail up the river and through the Great Lakes right into the middle of North America. It is the third largest river in Canada.

'''Seville''' ({{lang-es|Sevilla}}) is a big city in the South of [[Spain]], in [[Europe]]. A big river called the [[Guadalquivir]] River which goes through Seville.

The city of Seville is the capital of the Spanish region called [[Andalusia]] and of the province of [[Province of Seville|Sevilla]]. The people who live in the city are called ''Sevillanos'' and there are almost a million of them: 700,000.

== History ==
A very old story says that the city was started by the famous hero of [[Greece]], named [[Hercules]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] when they came to Spain gave it the [[Latin]] name of [[Hispalis]]. Over time this changed to be spelled in English as ''Seville''. The Arab [[Moors]] took the city when they invaded the country, and you can still see a lot of the buildings they built during their 800 year stay in Spain ([[711]]-[[1492]]).

In [[1992]] Seville was the place for the [[Expo 92]]. There is a beautiful bridge across the Guadalquivir River called ''Puente del Alamillo''. It was thought up by [[Santiago Calatrava]] a famous building expert.

Seville is famous for its hot summer weather.

== Education ==
* [[University of Seville]]. This is the oldest university is Sevilla. It is located near the Centro, or center of the city, across the street from Plaza de Espana and Parque Maria Luisa.
* [http://www.upo.es/portal/impe/web/portada?lang=en Pablo de Olavide University]. This website is located outside the main city of Sevilla, but is very easy to access using the subway system. It take about 30&nbsp;minutes to get from the center of town to Pablo de Olavide on the subway.
* [http://www.studiesabroad.com/programs/country/spain/city/sevilla/viewUniversity#inst12 Menéndez Pelayo International University-Sevilla]. This school is not your typical university. Only students who are studying abroad with International Studies Abroad attend classes at this school. It is lcoated near the Centro and Alfalfa Barrio.

== Sports ==
Seville is the home town of two [[football (soccer)|soccer]] teams, [[Sevilla FC]] (often simply called "El Sevilla") and [[Real Betis Balompié]] (often called "El Betis").

[[Category:Seville| ]]
[[Category:Capital cities in Spain]][[Image:Salami aka.jpg|thumb|Salami]]
Salami is a sausage that first came from Italy. The name comes from the Italian salare meaning to make something salty.

The original salami was made from a mix of chopped [[pork]] and salt which was dried using air in a casing. People who are Muslim are not allowed to eat this type of salami because it is pork. Now there are many types of salamis made in some countries. Nearly all are seasoned with a combination of [[herb]]s and [[spice]]s in addition to salt. Salamis are now sometimes smoked or cooked before air drying. Some kinds are made of [[beef]] while others mix beef and pork. Most, if not all Italian salamis have [[garlic]] in them, but few [[Germany|German]] kinds do, for example. Some, like a few salamis from [[Spain]], include [[paprika]] or [[Chili pepper|chili]]. The difference between some types is in how coarse or fine the meat is chopped.  Some "light" salami might add [[turkey]] or [[chicken]] to reduce both [[fat]] and [[calorie]]s.

Many salamis are named after the city or region where they come from. Some examples are [[Arles]], [[Genoa|Genoese]], [[Hungary|Hungarian]], and [[Milan]]o salamis.

[[Category:Sausage]]'''Special English''' is a simple form of the [[English language]].  It is used by a public [[radio]] station called [[Voice of America]], run by the [[United States]] [[government]] in Special English programs every [[day]]. Its [[new]]s and feature programs are read more slowly than usual, using fewer English [[word]]s and simple [[grammar]].  

The [[content]]s of Special English programs are much easier to understand.  Special English is clearer and simpler, and it uses shorter [[sentence]]s.  It can also help someone whose English is weak to improve his or her English.  In some countries, for example [[China]], Special English is popular among [[people]] learning English.

Special English was first used on [[October 19]], [[1959]].

'''Sausage''' is a food made of ground-up or chopped-up meat. It often has spices in it and is covered in a casing. Other meats, like the [[hot dog]], [[pepperoni]], [[bologna]], and [[salami]] also are covered with a casing like a sausage's.

Sausages often have meat from the animal's head, lips, cheeks, ears and other parts. Some have blood in them. [[Ireland|Irish]] and [[England|English]] sausages normally have a lot of "rusk," or bread crumbs, and they are less meaty than sausages from other countries.

Sausages may be used as a meal, in a [[sandwich]], or in other foods like [[stew]]s.

Many countries and regions have special kinds of sausage.  Sausages are some of the oldest foods.

[[Category:Sausage| ]]'''Slang''' are words that are  [[wikt:informal|informal]].  Usually each [[generation]] or social group has its own slang - for example, older people can have trouble understanding the slang of younger people.  On the other hand, younger people often understand, but find silly or old-fashioned, the slang of older people.

Over time, [[language]] tends to get more complex, since new [[word]]s enter much faster than old words leave.  Over time, slang almost always becomes part of the language, and approved for use by all.

It has also happened that some words used in [[Anglo-Saxon]] for bodily functions became thought of as [[profanity]] or rude after they were replaced by [[Latin]]ate words like "urinate", "defecate" and "copulate" - which polite people were supposed to use after the [[Norman conquest of England]] in [[1066]].  This was in part a way of making poor people (who spoke Anglo-Saxon) all appear to be rude, while more powerful people (who spoke Norman) appeared to be polite - one way that [[etiquette]] can develop, and reinforce [[power structure]].  This is only one example from [[history]] of how [[racism]] can be a reason for defining one group's language as 'slang' and another as 'correct'.

Wanting to have rules of [[grammar]] that do not change and the same [[vocabulary]] used by everyone for better communication is another reason that is often given for defining one group's language as correct.

An "[[idiom]]" can be slang, but it can also be a [[metaphor]] that becomes part of the culture.

Two examples of slang are 'wassup' and 'dunnoe'. 'Wassup' usually means 'What is up?' (as in, 'How are you?'), and 'dunnow' usually means 'I don't know'.

[[Category:Slang| ]]A '''social contract''' is an [[agreement]] between the [[people]] of a state and the government of a state.  The people agree to follow certain rules made by the government. These rules are usually called [[law]]s. Laws help to make sure people have [[rights]] and that their rights are taken care of. One kind of social contract is a [[constitution]]. A constitution sets limits on the [[Influence|powers]] of [[government]] [[leaders]], [[police]], and other people who have [[authority]].

The first social contracts were written by [[philosopher]]s such as [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].  They saw good government as coming from social contracts.  Rousseau wrote a book called ''[[The Social Contract]]''.  Both the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and [[United States Constitution]] are social contracts.

[[Category:Law]]'''Social capital''' is the willingness of people to help each other.  

It often replaces [[money]] which people would use to [[buy]] the same help.

[[Society]] works best when there is plenty of social capital. The less social capital there is, the more social [[problem]]s there usually are. If there is no social capital, [[war]] and [[revolution]] often [[wikt:result|results]].

People who have no [[money]] and cannot get help from [[society]] may have to agree to do things they do not want to do, or force others to do things they do not want to.  [[Organized crime]] grows in this way, and so do [[forced labour]] and [[slavery]].

Most ways of [[measure|measuring]] social capital have to do with [[:wikt:trust|trust]] - people who trust that favours and help will be available when they need it will favour and help others more.  Those who are seen as trying to get a free ride will get much less help.  A social climber tries to earn social capital by making friends with those who have it but without actually helping.  Some call this kind of person a social [[parasite]]. They are very hard to detect, unlike people who [[:wikt:cheat|cheat]] or commit [[fraud]]. When there are too many of these kinds of people, especially when they are [[politician]]s, people begin to {{broken wikt link|mistrust|mistrust}} their [[government]].  Rather than work with a [[political party]] to change [[law]], they may start to look for direct [[wikt:revenge|revenge]] for things. 

Social capital is a lot like real [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. The more money a person or a society has, the easier it is to do things and the better off people are. The less money, the more difficult things become and the worse people feel.

[[Category:Economics]]A '''site''' is a real fixed [[Matter|physical]] [[wikt:location|location]] where something will or has happened or a place where something is. 

== Uses ==
=== Uses in buildings ===
It is used very often in [[building trade]]s to mean the place where a [[building]] will go up.  

=== Uses in gravesites ===
A [[gravesite]] is a place where a person will be buried after they die.  

=== Uses in work ===
The words '''onsite''' and '''offsite''' refer to [[Labour (economics)|work]] that must take place on the site, or which can take place somewhere else.  For instance, a [[prefabricated]] building can be "built offsite" and then "moved onsite".

=== Use on the internet ===
''Site'' is also a common abbreviation in [[net jargon]] for "[[website]]".  In this case no real physical location exists other than the place where the [[computer]]s are, and one "goes to the site" simply by using a [[web browser]] to "go to" that [[URL]].  This is a [[conceptual metaphor]].  It can be confusing.  Someone who uses it is also likely using other [[jargon]].

{{disambig}}'''Subtraction''' is the [[arithmetic]] operation for finding the [[wikt:difference|difference]] between two [[number]]s. The special names of the numbers in a subtraction expression are, minuend - subtrahend = difference. The expression 7 - 4 = 3 can be spoken as "seven minus four equals three," "seven take away four leaves three," or "four from seven leaves three."

If the minuend is less than the subtrahend, the difference will be a [[negative number]]. For example, 17 - 25 = ( -8 ). We can say this as, "Seventeen minus twenty-five equals negative eight." This is how [[cash register]]s determine the [[change (money)|change]] you receive when you pay with more money than your purchase costs.

[[Category:Arithmetics]]'''String theory''' is a set of attempts to [[mathematical model|model]] the four known [[fundamental force|fundamental interaction]]s—[[gravitation]], [[electromagnetism]], [[strong nuclear force]], [[weak nuclear force]]—together in one theory. This tries to resolve the alleged conflict between [[classical physics]] and [[quantum physics]] by ''elementary units''—the one classical force: gravity, and a new [[quantum field theory]] of the other three fundamental forces.

[[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] had sought a unified field theory to explain the fundamental interactions within one model revealing the mechanics of the universe. Yet today's search for a unified field theory that is ''quantized'' and that explains matter's structure, too, is called the search for a [[theory of everything]] (TOE). The most prominent contender as a TOE is string theory converted into [[superstring theory]] with its 6 [[higher dimensions]] in addition to the [[4 common dimensions]] (3D + time). 

Multiple superstring theories appear to converge upon a shared range of [[geometry]] that, according to string theorists, is apparently the geometry of [[space]]. The mathematical framework that unifies the multiple superstring theories upon that shared geometrical range is [[M-theory]]. Many string theorists are optimistic that M-theory explains our universe's very structure and perhaps explains how other universes, if they exist, are structured as well. M theory/[[supergravity theory]] has 7 higher dimensions + 4D.

== Background ==

Introductions to string theory that are designed for the general public must first explain physics. Some of the controversies over string theory result from nonphysicists' misunderstandings about physics. A common misunderstanding even among scientists is the presumption that Newton's theory is proved true in its ''explanation'' of the natural world wherever its ''predictions'' are successful. Another misconception is that earlier physical scientists, including chemists, have already explained the world, a misconception suggesting that string theorists began generating strange hypotheses once they became unaccountably "set free from truth".<ref name=Horgan/>

=== Classical realm ===

==== Newtonian physics ====

Newton's law of universal gravitation (UG), added to the three Galilean laws of motion and some other presumptions, was published in 1687. Newton's theory successfully modeled interactions among objects of observable size, a range of phenomena now called the ''classical realm''. [[Benjamin Franklin|Franklin]] discovered electricity in the 1740s by capturing a lightning bolt. [[Coulomb's law]] modeled electric attraction. [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s [[electromagnetic field]] theory unified [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]], while [[optics]] emerged from this field.

[[Speed of light|Light's speed]] remained approximately constant when measured by an observer traveling in its field, however, although ''addition of velocities'' predicted the field to be slower or faster ''relative'' to the observer traveling with or against it. So versus the electromagnetic field, the observer's speed was continually lost. Still, no violation of [[Galilean invariance]]—whereby the laws of mechanics proceed identically for all objects exhibiting [[inertia]]—was observed.

(By [[law of inertia]], when no force is applied to an object, the object holds its velocity, which is speed ''and'' direction. An object either in ''uniform motion'', which is constant speed in an unchanging direction, or staying at rest, which is zero velocity, experiences inertia and thereby exhibits Galilean invariance—its mechanical interactions proceeding without variation—also called Galilean relativity since one cannot perceive whether one is at rest or in uniform motion.)

==== Relativity theory ====

===== Special relativity =====

In 1905, Einstein's [[special theory of relativity]] explained the accuracy of both Maxwell's electromagnetic field and Galilean relativity by stating that the field's speed is absolute—a universal constant—whereas both space and time are local phenomena ''relative'' to the object's energy. With respect to an observer, an object in relative motion shortens along the direction of its [[momentum]] (length contraction), and its unfolding of events slows (time dilation). A passenger on the object cannot detect the change, as all measuring devices—rods and clocks as well as eyes and brains—aboard that vehicle have experienced length contraction and time dilation. Only an external observer experiencing relative rest measures the object in relative motion shortened along its travel pathway and its events slowed. Special relativity left Newton's theory—which states space and time as ''absolute''—unable to explain gravitation.

By the [[equivalence principle]], Einstein inferred that being under either gravitation or constant acceleration are indistinguishable experiences that might share a physical mechanism. The suggested mechanism was ''progressive'' length contraction and time dilation—a consequence of the local energy density within 3D space—establishing a progressive tension within a rigid object, relieving its tension by moving toward the location of greatest energy density. Special relativity would be a limited case of a gravitational field. Special relativity would apply when the energy density across 3D space is uniform, and so the gravitational field is scaled uniformly from location to location, why an object experiences no acceleration and thus no gravitation.

===== General relativity =====

In 1915, Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]] newly explained gravitation with 4D spacetime modeled as a [[Lorentzian manifold]]. Time is one dimension merged with the three space dimensions, as every ''event'' in 3D space—2D horizontally and 1D vertically—entails a point along a 1D time axis. Even in everyday life, one states or implies both. One says or at least means, "Meet me at building 123 Main Street intersecting Franklin Street in apartment 3D on 10 October 2012 at 9:00PM". By omitting or missing the time coordinate, one arrives at the correct location in space when the sought event is absent—it is in the past or future at perhaps 6:00PM or 12:00AM.

By converging space and time and presuming both relative to the energy density in the vicinity, and by setting the only ''constant'' or absolute as not even mass but as light speed in a vacuum, general relativity revealed the natural world's previously unimagined balance and symmetry. Every object is always moving at light speed along a straight line—its equivalent, on a curved surface, called ''geodesic'' or ''worldline''—the one pathway of least resistance like a free fall through 4D spacetime whose geometry "curves" in the vicinity of mass/energy.

An object at light speed in a vacuum is moving at maximal rate through 3D space but exhibits no evolution of events—it is frozen in time—whereas an object motionless in 3D space flows fully along 1D time, experiencing the maximal rate of events' unfolding. The displayed universe is relative to a given location, yet once the mass/energy in that vicinity is stated, Einstein's equations predict what is occurring—or did occur or will occur—anywhere in the universe. The popularized notion that ''relative'' in Einstein's theory suggests ''subjective'' or ''arbitrary'' was to some regret of Einstein, who later thought he ought have to named it ''general theory''.

===== Cosmology =====

The electromagnetic field's messenger particles, [[photons]], carry an image timelessly across the universe while observers within this field have enough flow through time to decode this image and react by moving within 3D space, yet can never outrun this timeless image. The universe's state under 400 000 years after the presumed [[big bang]] that began our universe is thought to be displayed as the [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB).

In 1915, the universe was thought to be entirely what we now call the [[Milky Way]] galaxy and to be static. Einstein operated his recently published [[general theory of relativity|equations of the gravitational field]], and discovered the consequence that the universe was expanding or shrinking. (The theory is operable in either direction—time invariance.) He revised the theory add a ''cosmological constant'' to arbitrarily balance the universe. Nearing 1930, Edwin Hubble's telescopic data, interpreted through general relativity, revealed the universe was expanding.

In 1916 while on a [[World War I]] battlefield, Karl Schwarzschild operated Einstein's equations, and the Schwarzschild solution predicted black holes. Decades later, astrophysicists identified a supermassive black hole in the center of perhaps every galaxy. Black holes seem to lead galaxy formation and maintenance by regulating star formation and destruction.

In the 1930s, it was noticed that according to general relativity, galaxies would fall apart unless surrounded by invisible matter holding a galaxy together, and by the 1970s [[dark matter]] began to be accepted. In 1998 it was inferred that the universe's expansion, not slowing, is accelerating, indicating a vast energy density—enough to accelerate both visible matter and dark matter—throughout the universe, a vast field of [[dark energy]]. Apparently, under 5% of the universe's composition is known, while the other 95% is mysterious—dark matter and dark energy.

=== Quantum realm ===

==== Strange mechanics ====

By the 1920s, to probe the operating of the electromagnetic field at miniscule scales of space and time, quantum mechanics (QM) was developed. Yet [[electron]]s—the matter particles that interact with the [[photon]]s that are the electromagnetic field's force carriers—would appear to defy mechanical principles altogether. None could predict a quantum particle's location from moment to moment.

In the [[slit experiment]], an electron would travel through one hole placed in front of it. Yet a single electron would travel simultaneously though multiple holes, however many were placed in front of it. The single electron would leave on the detection board an [[interference pattern]] as if the single particle were a wave that had passed through all the holes simultaneously. And yet this occurred only when unobserved. If light were shone on the expected event, the photon's interaction with the field would set the electron to a single position.

By the [[uncertainty principle]], any quantum particle's exact location and momentum cannot be determined with certainty, however. The particle's interaction with the observation/measurement instrument deflects the particle such that greater determination of its position yields lower determination of its momentum, and vice versa.

==== Field theory quantized ====

By extending quantum mechanics across a field, a consistent pattern emerged. From location to adjacent location, the probability of the particle existing there would rise and fall like a wave of probability—a rising and falling [[probability density]].  When unobserved, any quantum particle enters [[superposition]], such that even a single particle fills the entire field, however large.  Yet the particle is not ''definitely'' anywhere in the field, but there at a definite ''probability'' in relation to whether it was had been at the adjacent location.  The waveform of Maxwell's electromagnetic field was generated by an accumulation of probabilistic events.  Not the particles, but the mathematical form, was constant.

Setting the field to special relativity permitted prediction of the complete electromagnetic field.  Thus arose relativistic [[quantum field theory]] (QFT).  Of the electromagnetic field, it is relativistic [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED).  Of the weak and electromagnetic fields together, it is relativistic [[electroweak theory]] (EWT).  Of the strong field, it is relativistic [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD).  Altogether, this became the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]].

==== Division in physics ====

When the [[Standard Model]] is set to general relativity in order to include mass, probability densities of infinity appear.  This is presumed incorrect, as probability ordinarily ranges from 0 to 1—0% to 100% probability.  Some theoretical physicists suspect that the problem is in the [[Standard Model]], which represents each particle by a zero-dimensional point that in principle can be infinitely small. Yet in quantum physics, the [[Planck's constant]] is the minimum energy unit that a field can be divided into, perhaps a clue to the smallest size a particle can be.  So there is a quest to ''quantize'' gravity—to develop a theory of [[quantum gravity]].

== Concept ==

=== Framework ===

String conjectures that on the microscopic scale, Einstein's 4D spacetime is a field of [[Calabi-Yau manifold]]s, each containing 6 space dimensions curled up, thus not extended into the 3 space dimensions presented to the classical realm.  In string theory, each quantum particle is replaced by a 1D string of vibrating energy whose length is the [[Planck length]].  As the string moves, it traces width, and thus becomes 2D, a worldsheet.  As a string vibrates and moves within the 6D [[Calabi-Yau space]], the string becomes a quantum particle.  With this approach, the hypothetical [[graviton]]—predicted to explain general relativity—emerges easily.

=== Theories ===

String theory began as bosonic string theory, whose 26 dimensions act as many fewer.  Yet this modeled only [[boson]]s, which are energy particles, while omitting [[fermion]]s, which are matter particles.  So bosonic string theory could not explain matter.  Yet by adding supersymmetry to bosonic string theory, fermions were achieved, and string theory became ''super''string theory, explaining matter, too.

(In versions of quantum field theory that include supersymmetry (SUSY), each boson has a corresponding fermion, and vice versa.  That is, each energy particle has a corresponding matter particle, and each matter particle has a corresponding energy particle, yet the unobservable partner is more massive and thus ''super''.  These superpartners might seem an extravagant prediction, yet many theorists and experimentalists favor supersymmetric versions of the Standard Model, whose equations must otherwise be tweaked extravagantly and sometimes arbitrarily to maintain predictive success or mathematical consistency, but with the superpartners align.)

== Controversies ==

=== Untestable—unscientific? ===

String theory's claim that all molecules are ''strings of energy'' has drawn harsh criticism.<ref name=Horgan>Horgan J, [http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/16/opinion/science-set-free-from-truth.html?pagewanted=all "Science set free from truth"], ''N Y Times'', 16 Jul 1996</ref>  There are many versions of string theory, none quite successfully predicting the observational data explained by the [[Standard Model]].  M theory is now known to have countless solutions, often predicting things strange and unknown to exist.  Some allege that string theorists select only the desired predictions.

The allegation that string theory makes no testable predictions is false, as it makes many.  No theory—a predictive and perhaps explanatory model of some domain of natural phenomena—is verifiable.  All conventional physical theories until the [[Standard Model]] have made claims about unobservable aspects of the natural world.  Even the Standard Model has various interpretations as to the natural world.  When the Standard Model is operated, it is often made a version with supersymmetry, doubling the number of particle species so far identified by particle physicists.

None can literally measure space, yet [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] postulated [[absolute space and time]], and Newton's theory made explicit predictions, highly testable and predictively successful for 200 years, but the theory was still falsified as explanatory of nature.  Physicists accept that there exists no such attractive force directly attracting matter to matter, let alone that the force traverses the universe instantly.<ref name=Stanford>Stanford PK, ''Exceeding Our Grasp: Science, History, and the Problem of Unconceived Alternatives'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), [http://books.google.com/books?id=_JIxeQ_sfzwC&pg=PA204&dq=heart pp 204-5]</ref>  And yet Newton's theory is still paradigmatic of science, even more scientific than the very framework of modernist biology, the [[Modern evolutionary synthesis]].<ref>Murray BG Jr, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11396849 "Are ecological and evolutionary theories scientific?"], ''Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc'', 2001 May;'''76'''(2):255-89</ref>

=== Hidden dimensions? ===

The idea of hidden dimensionality of space can seem occult.  Some theorists of [[loop quantum gravity]]—a contender for [[quantum gravity]]—regard string theory as fundamentally misguided by presuming that space even has a shape until particles shape it.  That is, they do not doubt that space takes various shapes, simply regard the particles as determining space's shape, not the other way around.  The spacetime vortex predicted by general relativity is apparently confirmed.

If interpreted as naturally true, the [[Standard Model]], representing a quantum particle as a 0D point, already indicates that spacetime is a sea of roiling shapes, [[quantum foam]].  String theorists tend to believe nature more elegant, a belief that loop theorist Lee Smolin dismisses as romantic while using biology's Modern Synthesis as a rhetorical device.<ref name=Smolin2007p19>Smolin L, ''The Trouble With Physics: The Rise of String Theory, The Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next'' (New York: Mariner Books, 2007), [http://books.google.com/books?id=d6MIUlxY-qwC&pg=PA19 p 19]</ref>  Experiments to detect added spatial dimensions have so far failed, yet there is still the possibility that signs of them can emerge.<ref name=Economist19Jul12012/>

=== So many solutions? ===

M theory has many trillions of solutions.<ref name=Powell>Powell CS, [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/15/books/review/15powell.html "Across the megaverse: Book review of ''Cosmic Lanscape'' by Leonard Susskind"], ''N Y Times'', 15 Jan 2006</ref>  Leonard Susskind, a leader of string theory, interprets string theory's plasticity of solutions as paradoxical support resolving the mystery of why ''this'' universe exists, as M theory shows it but a variant of a general pattern that always approximately results.<ref name=Powell/>

General relativity has brought many discoveries that in 1915 were all but unimaginable except in fiction.  A solution of Einstein's equations that sought to explain quantum particles' dynamics, the [[Einstein-Rosen Bridge]] predicts a shortcut connecting two distant points in spacetime.  Commonly called a wormhole, the Einstein-Rosen Bridge is doubted but not disproved, showing either that not all consequences of a theory must be accurate or that reality is quite bizarre in ways unobservable.

==== Many worlds ====

Even the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics suggests bizarre possibilities that populist accounts of science either omit or mention as unexplained curiosities.  The theory conventionally receives the [[Copenhagen interpretation]], whereby the field is only ''possibilities'', none real until an observer or instrument interacts with the field, whose [[wavefunction]] then collapses and leaves only its particle function, only the particles being real.  Yet wavefunction collapse was merely assumed—neither experimentally confirmed nor even mathematically modeled—and no variance from either the wavefunction in the quantum realm or the particle function in the classical realm has been found.<ref name=NovaManyworlds>''Nova'', [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/many-worlds-theory-today.html "The many worlds theory today"], PBS Online, 21 Oct 2008</ref>

In 1957 Hugh Everett described his "Relative state" interpretation.  Everett maintained that the wavefunction does not collapse, and since all matter and interactions are presumed to be built up from quantum waveparticles, all possible variations of the quantum field—indicated by the mathematical equations—are ''real'' and simultaneously occurring but different courses of history.<ref name=NovaManyworlds/>  By this interpretation, whatever interacts with the field joins the field's state that is ''relative'' to the observer's state—itself a waveform in its own quantum field—while the two simply interact in a [[universal waveform]] never collapsing.  By now, many physicists' interpretation of the apparent transition from the quantum to the classical realms is not wavefunction collapse, but [[quantum decoherence]].

In decoherence, an interaction with the field takes the observer into only one [[eigenstate|determinant constellation]] of the quantum field, and so all observations align with that new, combined quantum state.  Everett's thesis has inspired [[Many worlds interpretation]], whereby within our universe are predicted to be virtually or potentially infinite parallel worlds that are real, yet each a minuscule distance from the other worlds.<ref name=NovaManyworlds/>  As each world's waveform is universal—not collapsing—and its mathematical relations are invariant, parallel worlds simply fill the gaps and do not touch.

==== Many universes ====

Einstein doubted that black holes, as predicted by the Schwarzschild solution, are real.  Some now conjecture that black holes do not exist as such but are [[dark energy]],<ref>Ball P, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/news050328-8 "Black holes 'do not exist'"], ''Nature News'', 31 Mar 2005</ref> or that our universe is both—a black hole and dark energy.<ref>Borland J [http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/10/dark-energy-exp "Dark energy explained? Maybe if universe is like a black hole…"], ''Wired Science'', 8 Oct 2007</ref>  The Scharwzchild solution of Einstein's equations can be maximally extended to predict a black hole having a flip side—another universe emerging from a [[white hole]].  Perhaps our universe's big bang was half of a ''big bounce'', something's collapse down to a black hole, and our universe popping out its other side as a white hole.<ref>Indiana Univ, [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/04/100406172648.htm "Our universe at home within a larger universe? So suggests physicist's wormhole research"], ''ScienceDaily'', 7 Apr 2010</ref>

=== Particles are strings? ===

Physicists widely doubt that quantum particles are truly 0D points as represented in [[Standard Model]], which offers ''formalism''—mathematical devices whose strokes predict phenomena of interest upon input of data—not ''interpretation'' of the mechanisms determining those phenomena.  Yet string theorists do tend to optimistically conjecture that the strings are both real and explanatory, not merely predictive devices.  It is far beyond the capacity of today's particle accelerators to propel any probing particles at energy levels high enough to overcome a quantum particle's own energy and determine whether it is a string.<ref name=UnivViennaMar2012>Univ Vienna, [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/03/120318144039.htm "Looking at quantum gravity in a mirror"], ScienceDaily'', 18 Mar 2012</ref>  Yet this limitation also exists on testing other theories of [[quantum gravity]].<ref name=UnivViennaMar2012/>  Developments suggest other strategies to "observe" the structure of quantum particles.<ref name=UnivViennaMar2012/>

Paradoxically, even if testing confirmed that particles are strings of energy, that still would not conclusively prove even that particles are strings, since there could be other explanations, perhaps an unexpected warpage of space although the particle was a 0D point of true solidity.  Even when predictions succeed, there are many possible explanations—the problem of [[underdetermination]]—and philosophers of science as well as some scientists do not accept even flawless predictive success as verification of the successful theory's explanations if these are posed as offering [[scientific realism]], true description of the natural world.<ref name=Stanford/>

=== Matter is energy? ===

Talk of particle physicists testing theoretical physicists' predicted particles by colliding particles in accelerators suggests that quantum particles are tiny Newtonian particles that experimentalists ''crack'' open to reveal their structure.<ref name=Economist19Jul12012>[http://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2012/07/qa-brian-greene "The Q&A: Brian Greene life after the Higgs"], ''Economist'' blog: Babbage, 19 Jul 2012</ref>  Instead, when two particles, each of a certain mass—measured in terms of ''energy'' as electronvolts—are collided, they can combine into a particle of that combined mass/energy, and the generated particle is "observed" for correspondence with the prediction.<ref name=Economist19Jul12012/>

It is not controversial among physicists that all particles are ''energy''.  Loop theorists, sometimes in rivalry with string theory, claim that spacetime itself converts into the particles.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/node/7963608 "Looping the loop: A new 'theory of everything' is gaining ground"], ''Economist'', 28 Sep 2006</ref>  Matter's being a special variant of energy was a consequence of Einstein's [[special theory of relativity]], and thereupon Einstein formalized the [[mass-energy equivalence]], E=mc<sup>2</sup>.  When sufficiently energetic photons collide, they can combine and generate matter—[[matter creation]].  All particles have [[antiparticle]]s, and atoms of matter have antiatoms of [[antimatter]], whose union annihilates the particles and matter while leaving [[photons|energy]].

== Developments ==

An inspiring development is discovery of mirror symmetry, whereby Calabi-Yau spaces tend to come in pairs such that solutions previously difficult within the extreme vibrational mode of one string can be solved by through the mirror Calabi-Yau space's geometry in its opposite range.

String theory is usually solved through [[conformal field theory]], a [[quantum field theory]] on 2D space.  It is confirmed that molecules can collapse to 2D.<ref>Natl High Mag Field Lab, [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/06/060601211745.htm "Raiders of the lost dimension: Understanding the quantum mechanics of the universe"], ''ScienceDaily'', 2 Jun 2006</ref><ref>McMillan F, [http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/print/2909/the-mysterious-colour-purple "The mysterious colour purple"], ''Cosmos'' Mag, 2008 Feb;19</ref>  And the electron, long presumed an elementary particle, apparently splits into three entities separately carrying the electron's three degrees of freedom when the molecules that contain the electrons are channeled through a 1D pathway.<ref>Schlappa J et al, [http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature10974 "Spin-orbital separation in the quasi-one-dimensional Mott insulator Sr2CuO3"], ''Nature'', 2012 May 3;'''485''':82-5</ref><ref>Merali Z, [http://www.nature.com/news/not-quite-so-elementary-my-dear-electron-1.10471 "Not-quite-so elementary, my dear electron"], ''Nature News'', 18 Apr 2012</ref><ref>Francis M, [http://arstechnica.com/science/2012/04/electrons-like-gaul-come-in-three-parts "Splitting up the indivisible: Quasiparticles separate an electron's spin, charge, and orbit"], ''ARS Technica'', 18 Apr 2012</ref>

{{religion-stub}}:''Some types of [[distillation|distilled]] [[alcohol]]ic [[drink]]s are also called '''spirits''' (as a plural, not "''spirit''").''

A '''spirit''' is considered to be the part of a [[being]] that is not the body. Other words with the same meanings are [[soul]] and [[ghost]]. When a body is alive, it has a spirit in it. [[Death]] is when the spirit separates from the body. 

[[Christian]]s believe that spirits exist in [[Heaven]] or [[Hell]]. (See [[1 Timothy]] 3:16, 4:1) 

[[Spiritual séance|Spiritualist]]s believe that spirits can talk with people, or change things in the world. Many religions forbid communicating with such spirits in any way, (see [[Leviticus]] 19:31) but a few include this as part of their practice.

Another use of ''spirit'' means the main purpose or [[definition|meaning]] of a sentence or [[wikt:document|document]]. For example, the "spirit of a [[law]]" is the true meaning of the law which the creator wanted.

[[Category:Spirituality]][[File:Brown Flax Seeds.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Flax]] seeds]]
A '''seed''' is the part of a [[seed plant]] which can grow into a new plant. It is a [[reproduction|reproductive]] structure which disperses,<ref>spreads away from the parent plant</ref> and can survive for some time. A typical seed includes three basic parts: (1) an [[embryo]], (2) a supply of [[nutrient]]s for the embryo, and (3) a seed coat.

There are many different kinds of seeds. Some plants make a lot of seeds, some make only a few. Seeds are often hard and very small, but some are larger. The [[coconut]] is as big as a [[child]]'s [[head]], but it contains more than just a seed. At the start, seeds are ''dormant'' (resting inside their coat) for a while. When the seed is ready to develop, it needs water, air and warmth ''but not sunlight'' to become a [[seedling]].

Seeds carry the [[food]] that helps the new plant begin to grow. This food store is in the [[endosperm]], and/or in the [[cotyledon]]s. Many kinds of seeds are good food for [[animals]] and [[wikt:people|people]]. The many kinds of [[grain]] that people grow, such as [[rice]], [[wheat]], and [[maize]], are all seeds. Seeds are often inside [[fruit]]s.

== Development from the seed ==
A seed, though not active, is a tiny living thing. It contains the embryo of the future plant, which is not changing or developing: it is ''dormant''. The common idea is that the seed "sleeps" until it gets what it needs to wake up. That is not correct. Different seeds have different habits, no doubt adapted to their [[habitat]]. There are different kinds of resting stages in seeds:<ref name="Baskin, C.C 1998">Baskin C.C. & Baskin J.M. 1998. ''Seeds: ecology, biogeography, and evolution of dormancy and germination''. Academic Press, [[San Diego]].</ref>
:1. Seed '''dormancy''': means the seed does not develop for a while ''even when conditions are suitable''.<ref name="Fenner">Fenner, Michael and Thompson, Ken 2005. ''The ecology of seeds''. Cambridge. ISBN 9780521653688</ref><sup>p98</sup> Delayed [[germination]] (development) allows time for dispersal. Changes take place inside the seed which sooner or later make it germinate. The details vary hugely between [[species]].
:2. Seed '''hibernation''': fails to germinate because conditions are not right. Growth is [[wikt:trigger|triggered]] by particular events in the [[environment]]. Details of the triggers are known for some, but not all, seeds. [[Rain]], [[fire]], ground [[temperature]], are examples. Many seeds only germinate after they have been [[eaten]] and passed through the [[digestive system]] of an animal. This also is a dispersal method.

When a seed germinates ("wakes up"), it begins to grow into a little plant called a ''seedling''.<ref name="Baskin, C.C 1998"/> It uses the soft fleshy [[material]] inside the seed for nutrients (food) until it is ready to make food on its own using sunlight, water and air.

Most seeds germinate underground where there is no sunlight. The plant does not need the nutrients in soil for a few days or weeks, because the seed has all the things it needs to grow.<ref name=Fenner/> Later, though, it will begin to need sunlight. If there is sunlight, the plant will use it to grow healthy. If there is no light, the plant will still grow for a while, but its [[plastid]]s will not mature: the chlorophyll does not turn green. If the plant does not get enough light, it will eventually die. It needs light to make food for itself when the reserve in the seed runs out.<ref name="Baskin, C.C 1998"/>

* The oldest [[Radiocarbon dating|carbon 14]]-dated seed that has grown into a plant was a Judean [[date palm]] seed about 2,000 years old, recovered from excavations at [[Agrippa I|Herod the Great]]'s palace on [[Masada]] in [[Israel]]. It was germinated in 2005.<ref>Roach, John. 2005.

* The largest seed is produced by the ''Coco de mer'', or "double coconut palm", ''Lodoicea maldivica''.  The entire fruit may weigh up to 23 kilograms (50 pounds) and usually contains a single seed.<ref>{{cite book |title=The natural history of Palms |author=Corner EJH |year=1966 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=313–4 }}</ref>

== Origin and evolution ==
Seeds have been an important development in the [[wikt:reproduction|reproduction]] and spread of [[conifer]]s and [[flowering plants]]. Plants such as [[moss]]es, [[liverwort]]s and [[fern]]s do not have seeds, and use unprotected [[spore]]s and other methods to [[wikt:propagation|propagate]] themselves. Before the upper [[Devonian]] period, land plants, like modern ferns, reproduced by sending spores into the air. The spores would land and become new plants only in favourable conditions. Spores have little food stored, and may be just single cells rather than embryos. 

The evolution of seeds changed the plant [[life cycle]] by freeing plants from the need for external water for [[sexual reproduction]], and by providing protection and nutrients for the developing embryo. These functions allowed plants to expand beyond the immediate neighbourhood of water sources. They were able to exploit environments which were drier and more upland.<ref name="Willis">Willis K.J. and McElwain J.C. 2002. ''The evolution of plants''. Oxford.</ref><sup>p92</sup> This can be seen by the success of seed plants in important biological [[Ecological niche|niche]]s on land, from [[forest]]s to [[grassland]]s both in hot and cold [[climate]]s. The present-day seed plants are the [[Gymnosperm]]s, with naked seeds, and the [[Angiosperm]]s with covered seeds, usually fruits.

The first true seeds are from the upper Devonian 370–354 million years ago, which is probably the theatre of their first [[evolution]]ary radiation. The earliest seed-producing [[tree]]s were in the forests of the [[Carboniferous]] period.<ref name="Willis"/><sup>p112</sup> The seed plants steadily became one of the most important elements of nearly all [[ecosystem]]s.

A '''sail''' is a large piece of [[cloth]] on the top of some [[boat]]s. The [[wind]] goes around the sail and makes the boat move through the [[water]]. The piece that the sail is attached to is called a [[mast]]. Some boats have many sails, and some have only one. Usually, small boats have only one sail, and bigger boats have more. Boats with sails are called ''sailing boats''. There are many different names for different kinds of sailing boats with different kinds of sails. 

Before people made boats with [[engine]]s that used [[coal]] or [[oil]], sailing boats were an important way to travel across [[ocean]]s. Now they are not so important for transport, but they are still used for [[recreation]] and [[competition]].

[[Image:Human skin structure.jpg|thumb|200px|Close view of the ''skin'' on a human hand.]]

'''Skin''' is the [[outside]] [[covering]] of [[animal]]s. The skin of different kinds of animals is very different. Many kinds of animals have [[hair]] or [[fur]] on their skin. [[Bird]]s have [[feather]]s on their skin. Most [[fish]], and [[reptile]]s, like [[snake]]s and [[lizard]]s, have scales on their skin. 

The skin of [[human being]]s usually has very small [[hair]]s on it that are hard to see. Some people have more hair, or hair that is easier to see, and some have less. People have hair that is longer and easier to see on some parts of their [[body|bodies]], such as the tops of their heads and [[men]]'s [[beard]]s. 

The skin of cows can be made into [[leather]]. Leather is sometimes used to make [[shoe]]s, [[bag]]s, and [[ball]]s.

Other things can be said to have "skins". People often say that [[fruit]]s, such as [[apple]]s and [[banana]]s, and [[vegetable]]s, such as [[potato]]es, have "skins".

[[Category:Basic English 850 words]]
[[Category:Integumentary system]]A '''web search engine''' is a type of [[website]] that helps a computer user find information on the [[Internet]]. It does this by looking through other [[web pages]] for the text the user wants to find. The software that does this is known as a [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]].

To use a search engine you must enter at least one keyword in to the search box.  Usually an on-screen button must be clicked on to submit the search.  The search engine looks for matches between the keyword(s) entered and its database of websites and words.

Quickly after a search is submitted the results appear on screen.  This is called a search engine results page (SERP).   The SERP is a list of webpages that contain matches to the keywords that were searched.  The SERP usually shows web pages names, short descriptions and a link for each matching web page. The user can click on any of the links to go to one of the websites.  

Search engines are some of the most advanced websites on the web.  They use special computer code to sort the web pages on SERPs.  The most popular or highest quality web pages will be near the top or the list. 

When a user type words into the search engine, it looks for web pages with those words. There could be thousands, or even millions, of web pages with those words. So, the search engine helps users by putting the web pages it thinks the user wants first.

Search engines are very useful to find information about anything quickly and easily.  Using more keywords or different keywords improves the results of searches.  

[[Google]], [[Yahoo!]], [[Ask.com]], [[Forestle]] and [[Bing]] are popular search-engine websites. Some older services include [[Webcrawler]], [[Lycos]], and [[Alta Vista]].

A search service may also include a [[portal]] with news, games, and more information besides a search engine. [[Yahoo!]] has a popular portal, and [[MSN Search]] is part of the [[MSN]] portal, while [[Google]] has a simple design on its front page. Search services usually work without charging money for finding sites, and are often supported with text or banner advertisements.

[[Category:Internet]]{{About|the Christian day of rest|the Jewish day of rest|Shabbat}}
'''Sabbath''' in Christianity is the day of rest and service to God.  The idea of the Sabbath in Christianity comes directly from the idea
of the Sabbath (or [[Shabbat]]) in Judaism.  In fact, the word Sabbath itself comes from the Hebrew word ''Shabbat.''  Like the Jewish Sabbath (Shabbat), the Sabbath in Christianity comes from the [[Genesis]] story of [[Creationism|Creation]].<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|2:1–3|HE}}</ref>  But unlike Jews, most Christians have Sabbath on [[Sunday]], not [[Saturday]]. They also rest, but not the same way as Jews. The exact way depends on the church [[Religious denomination|denomination]]. 

==Differing views==
{{complex|1=section|date=May 2013}}
Most [[Christians]] honor the Sabbath on Sunday to remember the [[Resurrection]] of Jesus on the first day of the week on the Jewish calendar. They say that there is an [[analogy]] between the obligation of the Christian day of worship and the Sabbath-day ordinance. These two rules are not literally identical though. They say that this ordinance is no longer valid, because God has replaced his old creation by a new one.<ref>{{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|5:17}}</ref> For this reason, the obligation to keep the Sabbath is not the same for Christians as for Jews. They say there are examples in the New Testament, and in other writings surviving from the first few centuries. 

Some conservative Christians are "Sabbatarians". Most of these follow the [[Reformation|Reformed]] traditions. Sabbatarians think the first day of the week or ''Lord's Day'' is the new Sabbath. This is because the 4th commandment has never been revoked and Sabbath-keeping is in any case a creation ordinance. 

Still others believe that the Sabbath remains as a day of rest on the Saturday, reserving Sunday as a day of worship. In reference to Acts 20:7, the disciples came together on the first day of the week (Sunday) to break bread and to hear the preaching of the apostle Paul. This is not the first time Christians assembled together on a Sunday; Jesus appeared to the Christians on the "first day of the week" while they were in hiding. One can maintain this argument in that Jesus himself maintained the Sabbath, although not within the restrictions that were mandated by Jewish traditions;  the Pharisees often tried Jesus by asking him if certain tasks were acceptable according to the Law.<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|14:5}}</ref> This would seem to show that while the Sabbath was still of importance to the Jews, Sunday was a separate day for worship and teaching from Scriptures.

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] and other churches disagree with some of these views. They argue that the custom of meeting for worship on Sunday originated in [[paganism]], specifically [[Sol Invictus]] and Mithraism (in which [[sun]] [[god]] worship took place on Sunday){{fact|date=December 2012}}. This is therefore an explicit rejection of the commandment to keep the ''seventh'' day holy. Instead, they keep Saturday as the Sabbath as a memorial to God's work of creation<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|2:1–3|9}}, {{bibleverse||Exodus|20:8–11|9}}, {{bibleverse||Exodus|16:23,29–30|9}}</ref> believing that none of the Ten Commandments can ever be destroyed.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|5:17–19|9}}, {{bibleverse||Exodus|31:16|9}}</ref> Seventh-day Sabbatarians claim that the seventh day Sabbath was kept by the majority of Christian groups until the [[2nd century|2nd]] and [[3rd century]], by most until the 4th and 5th century, and a few thereafter, but because of opposition to Judaism after the [[Jewish-Roman wars]], the original custom was gradually replaced by Sunday as the day of worship. The history of these changes is certainly not altogether lost regardless of any belief in a suppression of the facts by a conspiracy of the pagans of the [[Roman Empire]] and the clergy of the Catholic Church. 

Jews had come to be hated in the Roman Empire after the [[Jewish-Roman wars]]. This led to the criminalization of the Jewish Sabbath. Hatred of Jews is apparent in the [[Council of Laodicea]] (4th Century AD) where Canon 37–38 states: "It is not lawful to receive portions sent from the feasts of Jews or heretics, nor to feast together with them." and "It is not lawful to receive unleavened bread from the Jews, nor to be partakers of their impiety." [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3806.htm] In keeping with this rejection of the Jews, this Roman council also criminalized the Jewish Sabbath as can be seen in Canon 29 of the Council Laodicea: "Christians must not Judaize by resting on the Sabbath, but must work on that day, rather honoring the Lord's Day; and, if they can, resting then as Christians. But if any shall be found to be [[judaizers]], let them be [[excommunication|excommunicated]] from Christ."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3806.htm|title=Website of the New Adventist Church}}</ref>

In the [[Gospel of Mark]] 2:28 [[Jesus]] says 'the [[Son of God|Son of Man]] is lord even of the sabbath'.

[[Category:Christian holidays]]{{for|statistics about Wikipedia|Wikipedia:Statistics}}

'''Statistics''' is the [[science]] of [[Information|data]]. It enables the [[data collection|collection]], [[analysis]], [[interpretation|understanding]], and [[presentation]] of data.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Moses, Lincoln E. | title = Think and Explain with statistics | pages = 1 - 3 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | year = 1986}}</ref> It helps in the study of many other fields, such as [[medicine]], [[economics]], [[psychology]], and [[marketing]]. Someone who works in statistics is called a statistician.

Statistics provides ways to get the data needed for a study without waste, such as [[Statistical survey|surveys]] and controlled [[experiment]]s. Once the data has been collected, there are two basic ways that data can be analysed:

# First, statistics can help ''describe'' the data. This is known as ''[[descriptive statistics]]''. Descriptive statistics is about finding meaningful ways to [[wikt:summary|summarize]] the data, because it is easier to use the "summary" than having to use the whole set of data all the time. Summarizing the data also allows to find common [[pattern]]s. In statistics, such patterns are called [[probability distribution]]s.  The basic idea is to look at the results of an experiment, and look at how the results are grouped.
# Once the results have been summarized and described they can be used for [[prediction]]. This is called ''[[Inferential statistics|Inferential Statistics]]''. As an example, the size of an animal is dependent on many factors. Some of these factors are controlled by the [[environment]], but others are by [[Mendelian inheritance|inheritance]]. A [[biologist]] might therefore make a [[Mathematical model|model]] that says that there's a high [[probability]], the [[offspring]] will be small in size if the parents were small in size. This model probably allows to predict the size in better ways than by just guessing at random. Testing whether a certain [[drug]] can be used to cure a certain condition or disease is usually done by comparing the results of people who are given the drug against those of people who are given a [[placebo]].

== History ==
Statistics have been in use for a long time. The first known statistics are [[census]] data. The [[Babylonia]]ns did a census around 3500BC, the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] around 2500 BC, and the Ancient [[China|Chinese]] around 1000 BC.

== Collecting data ==
Before we can describe the world with statistics, we must collect [[Information|data]]. The data that we collect in statistics are called [[measurement]]s. After we collect data, we use one or more numbers to describe each observation or measurement. For example, suppose we want to find out how popular a certain TV show is. We can pick a group of people (called a ''[[Sample (statistics)|sample]]'') out of the total [[population (statistics)|population]] of viewers. Then we ask each one how often they watch the show, or (better) we measure it by attaching a counter to each of their television sets. For another example, if we want to know whether a certain [[drug]] can help lower [[blood pressure]], we could give the drug to people for some time and measure their blood pressure before and after.

== Methods ==
Most often we collect statistical data by doing [[survey]]s or [[experiment]]s. To do a survey, we pick a small number of people and ask them [[question]]s. Then, we use their answers as the data.

The choice of which [[individual]]s to take for a survey or data collection is important, as it directly [[wikt:influences|influences]] the statistics. When the statistics are done, it can no longer be determined which individuals are taken. Suppose we want to measure the water quality of a big lake. If we take samples next to the waste drain, we will get different results than if the samples are taken in a far away, hard to reach, spot of the lake.

There are two kinds of problems which are commonly found when taking samples:

# If there are many samples, the samples will likely be very close to what they are in the real [[population]]. If there are very few samples, however, they might be very different from what they are in the real population.  This error is called a [[chance error]] (see [[Errors and residuals in statistics]]).
# The individuals for the samples need to be chosen carefully, usually they will be chosen randomly. If this is not the case, the samples might be very different from what they really are in the total population. This is true even if a great number of samples is taken. This kind of error is called [[bias]].

=== Errors ===
We can reduce chance errors by taking a larger sample, and we can avoid some bias by choosing randomly. However, sometimes large random samples are hard to take. And bias can happen if different people are not asked, or refuse to answer our questions, or if they know they are getting a fake treatment. These problems can be hard to fix. See also [[standard error]].

== Descriptive statistics ==
=== Finding the middle of the data ===
The middle of the data is called an [[average]]. The average tells us about a typical individual in the population. There are three kinds of average that are often used: the [[mean]], the [[median]] and the [[Mode (statistics)|mode]].

The examples below use this sample data:

  Name | A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J
 ---------------------------------------------
  score| 23  26  49  49  57  64  66  78  82  92

==== Mean ====
The formula for the '''[[mean]]''' is

<math>\\bar x = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i = \\frac{x_1+x_2+\\cdots+x_N}{N}</math>

Where <math>x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_N</math> are the data and <math>N</math> is the population size. (see [[Sigma Notation]]).

This means that you add up all the [[value]]s, and then [[Division (mathematics)|divide]] by the number of values.

In our example <math>\\bar x =  (23+26+49+49+57+64+66+78+82+92)/10 = 58.6</math>

The problem with the mean is that it does not tell anything about how the values are [[wikt:distributed|distributed]]. Values that are very large or very small change the mean a lot. In statistics, these extreme values might be errors of measurement, but sometimes the population really does contain these values. For example, if in a room there are 10 people who make $10/day and 1 who makes $1,000,000/day. The mean of the data is $90,918/day. Even though it is the average amount, the mean in this case is not the amount any single person makes, and is probably useless.

==== Median ====
The '''[[median]]''' is the middle item of the data. To find the median we [[sort]] the data from the smallest number to the largest number and then choose the number in the middle. If there is an [[even]] number of data, there will not be a number right in the middle, so we choose the two middle ones and calculate their mean. In our example there are 10 items of data, the two middle ones are "57" and "64", so the median is (57+64)/2 = 60.5.  Another example, like the income example presented for the mean, consider a room with 10 people who have incomes of $10, $20, $20, $40, $50, $60, $90, $90, $90, $100, and $1,000,000, the median is $55 because $55 is the average of the two middle numbers, $50 and $60.  If the extreme value of $1,000,000 is ignored, the mean is $57.  In this case, the median is close to the value obtained when the extreme value is thrown out.  The median solves the problem of extreme values as described in the definition of '''mean''' above.

==== Mode ====
The '''[[Mode (statistics)|mode]]''' is the most frequent item of data. For example the most common letter in English is the letter "e". We would say that "e" is the mode of the distribution of the letters.

For example, if in a room there are 10 people with incomes of $10, $20, $20, $40, $50, $60, $90, $90, $90, $100, and $1,000,000, the mode is $90 because $90 occurs three times and all other values occur fewer than three times.

There can be more than one mode.  For example, if in a room there are 10 people with incomes of $10, $20, $20, $20, $50, $60, $90, $90, $90, $100, and $1,000,000, the modes are $20 and $90.  This is bi-modal, or has two modes.  Bi-modality is very common and often indicates that the data is the combination of two different groups.  For instance, the average height of all adults in the U.S. has a bi-modal distribution.  This is because males and females have separate average heights of 1.763 m (5 ft 9 + 1⁄2 in) for men and 1.622 m (5 ft 4 in) for women.  These peaks are apparent when both groups are combined.

The mode is the only form of average that can be used for data that can not be put in order.

=== Finding the spread of the data ===
Another thing we can say about a set of data is how spread out it is. A common way to describe the spread of a set of data is the [[standard deviation]]. If the standard deviation of a set of data is small, then most of the data is very close to the average. If the standard deviation is large, though, then a lot of the data is very different from the average.

If the data follows the common pattern called the normal distribution, then it is very useful to know the standard deviation. If the data follows this pattern (we would say the data is ''normally distributed''), about 68 of every 100 pieces of data will be off the average by less than the standard deviation. Not only that, but about 95 of every 100 measurements will be off the average by less that two times the standard deviation, and about 997 in 1000 will be closer to the average than three standard deviations.

=== Other descriptive statistics ===
We also can use statistics to find out that some [[percent]], [[percentile]], [[number]], or [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] of people or things in a group do something or fit in a certain [[category]].

For example, [[social science|social scientists]] used statistics to find out that 49% of people in the world are [[males]].

'''Speed''' is the [[distance]] that an [[wikt:object|object]] [[movement|moves]] in a given amount of [[time]]. Speed is a [[measure]] of how fast something is moving. The '''average speed''' of an object in a certain time is the distance the object traveled [[Division (mathematics)|divided]] by the time.  

==Finding speed==
To find speed <math>s</math>,

<math>s =</math><math> d \\over t</math>

where <math>d</math> is the distance and <math>t</math> is the time that has gone by.

==Units of measurement for speed==
There are many [[units of measurement]] for speed. For example, an object's speed can be measured in 
*[[miles]] per [[hour]] (mph),
*[[kilometre|kilometers]] per hour (km/h)
*[[metre|meter]]s per [[second]] (m/s), which is the [[SI|SI-unit]] for speed.

==Changing speed==
When an object changes speed, it gets faster or [[slow]]er. If the speed of the object increases, it is called [[acceleration]]. If the object gets slower, and the speed [[wikt:decrease|decreases]], it is called [[deceleration]], or [[negative]] acceleration.

''A server is also a person who serves, like a [[waiter]] at a restaurant or in a hotel''
: 
In [[net jargon]], a '''server''' is a [[computer]] that serves many things to [[:wikt:user|user]], or [[client]] machines. Usually a server will only do a few things. Every type of thing a server does is called a service. Services are used by other computers that are called clients. The relationship between the client and the server is called a [[client-server]] relationship. For example, Wikipedia has a web server which has a service for sending web pages over the Internet. Your client computer talks to the Wikipedia's web page service to get web pages for you. A server can also host internet games and allow file sharing. In simple words, the individual computers are connected to some powerful computers called servers. These store files and information in the form of website. These files can be accessed by different users anywhere from the world using an internet connection.

So that servers and clients can talk to each other, they need to be connected to a [[computer network|network]], and they need to use the same [[protocol]]. In networks, a protocol is a set way for machines to talk to other machines. It is just like a language. For example, the Wikipedia server runs the [[HTTP]] ('''H'''yper'''t'''ext '''T'''ransfer '''P'''rotocol) to send [[web site]]s to your [[computer]], and your computer uses the HTTP Protocol to ask Wikipedia for pages.

Usually, servers are specially made to be more powerful and reliable, and they are much more expensive than normal computers. Sometimes, servers can be clustered, which means that lots of servers work together to do one service.

The server might slow down if there are too many people accessing the server at the same time, resulting in a high load. It might also be unable to take the high load, so it will automatically shut down.

In a [[peer-to-peer]] system, every computer is both a client and a server to each other. This is commonly put into [[file sharing]] and [[VOIP]]. However, this can help in attempts at [[copyright infringement|piracy]].
Many game servers use a large server for players to store their gaming data and can access them anytime with an internet connection. 

Typical server operating systems are [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], and [[OpenBSD]]. Unlike other computers, a server often has no monitor, keyboard, or mouse. When a server doesn't have to do very much, server software can run on a computer that is also doing other things.

==Web server==

A '''web server''' is a type of server that is used to [[host]] [[website]]s. Some examples of web servers are [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] or [[Internet information services|IIS]]. A web server can have one, or many, websites that it hosts. The [[default]] [[port_(networking)|port]] for a web server to [[listen]] to is port 80 ([[HTTP]]) or 443 ([[HTTPS]]).

Web servers have different things they can do more than just serving a web page. For example, some web servers have something called [[Server side include|SSI]] that makes [[build]]ing a website easier.

Web servers use [[service]]s like [[Common gateway interface|CGI]] to let [[software]] on the server make web pages. Some of the [[programming language]]s that can use CGI are [[scripting]] languages like [[Perl]], [[Python]], [[PHP]], or [[ASP]]. Some are [[compile]]d languages like [[C++]] or [[Java]].

Similes use comparisons, with the words '[[like]]' or 'as'. Metaphors use indirect comparisons, without the words 'like' or 'as'.

[[Category:Figures of speech]]{{otheruses}}

In modern [[politics]], a '''state''' is an [[association]] which has control over a [[geography|geographic]] [[area]] or [[territory]]. States are seen as having three main pieces:
*A [[territory]]
*A [[people]]
*Some [[institution]]s (which have the power to make rules).

There are different forms of [[government]] a state can have, for example a [[republic]] or a [[monarchy]]. Sometimes states form their own countries. At other times many states work together to form a country (like the [[United States]]). Most states also have [[armed forces]], [[civil service]], [[law]] and [[police]].

== History ==
=== Early states ===
The earliest states were just groups of power. A group of farms working together or a group of factories working together could be 'states' since people can control them and protect them.

More organized states could be the [[monarchy|monarchies]] such as early [[Egypt]] under the [[Pharaoh]]. Following this were larger more [[military]]-based states such as the [[Roman Empire]]. The most important early states, however, were the [[Ancient Greek]] states which had freedom, writing and a democracy.

=== From military to modern state ===
When the military-based state, the Roman Empire, fell, lots of little states were made and each was also military-based and controlled by a [[king]]. These states did not often work together and war raged. However, once people within the state itself started fighting (what's called a [[Civil war]]), the kings had to make [[peace]] and start [[parliaments]].

=== Modern states ===
[[Image:Circulation in macroeconomics.svg|thumb|200px|The state's (government's) position in the [[macroeconomics|economy]]]]
Modern states soon started in the late 15th century. The main states in Europe were:
*[[Kingdom of England|England]] under the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudors]]
*[[Spain]] under the [[Hapsburg]]s
*[[France]] under the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]]
*[[Russia]] under [[Catherine the Great]] and Alexander the Second

These states all tried to improve their politics and economy and became more and more like the states today. They formed proper [[frontier|boundaries]] for their lands and worked with power within the state itself more, such as the [[Church]] or the [[nobility]]. They made [[army|armies]], [[tax]] systems and [[embassy|embassies]] all to help make them more powerful and [[stability|stable]].

== Different types of state ==
Types of state can be separated into two [[category|categories]]: [[democracy]] and [[dictatorship]]. However, just because a group of states are all democratic does not mean that they follow the same rules. [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States|United States of America]] are all states. Each of them sees itself as a [[democracy]]. Each of them however has a different idea of what ''democracy'' really means.

Different states of the same 'category' can also function differently. For example, two democratic states may be quite different if one has a well-trained [[police]] or [[army]] while the other does not. Therefore, the word 'state' only tells us what type of government that state follows (democratic or dictatorship) and does not tell us about the country itself.<ref name=Bobbio>Bobbio, Norberto. 1989.

=== Sub-categories of state ===
There are lots of sub-types of state branching off from democracy and dictatorship. The main ones are [[Pluralism]], [[Marxism]] and [[Institutionalism]].

==== Pluralism ====
Pluralism has been very popular in the United States. It shows the state as a [[neutral]] place for settling [[arguments]] between other states. Pluralism tells us that all people are not [[Social equality|equal]], but still allows each group of people to tell the state what to do. This type of state is called a [[polyarchy]].<ref>Robert Dahl. 1973. [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0135969816&id=9XY5gFcp6n0C&q=Dahl+Modern+Political+Analysis&dq=Dahl+Modern+Political+Analysis&pgis=1 Modern Political Analysis]. Prentice Hall. [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0135969816&id=9XY5gFcp6n0C&q=Dahl+Modern+Political+Analysis&dq=Dahl+Modern+Political+Analysis&pgis=1 ISBN 0135969816]</ref>

Also in a pluralist state, politics, the military and the economy are all united and work together. This means that all power in the state is '[[diffusion|diffused]]' across the people who live there.

==== Marxism ====
Marxism was popular in [[Europe]] in the [[1960s]] and [[1970s]]. It was started by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]. Marxism rejects the idea that a state is there for all the people living in it, and is definitely not a neutral place for settling arguments.

The main job of a Marxist state is to protect [[capitalist]]-made profits and to help people make [[contract]]s to keep economy in the state fair. This is a good idea, however, the person who makes the money by using production or contracts has power over the people who do not make as much money as him. This means that the [[working class]] (the people who work in [[factory|factories]] etc.) have hardly any power but the people who own the factories have a lot of power.<ref>Sweezy, Paul. 1942. The Theory of Capitalist Development. New York: Monthly Review, ch. 13.</ref> Basically, instead of giving power to everyone such as a polyarchy would do, only a small part of the people have power.

==== Institutionalism ====
Both Marxism and Pluralism states have to react to the activities of groups of people in the state itself. Institutionalist states do not see themselves as 'instruments' to be [[control]]led, they are more just geographical areas. In this area, the people just form groups themselves. An Institutionalist state can be made up of both Marxist and Pluralist people, both which have the power to control themselves and not [[influence]] the other parties of the state.<ref>Rueschemeyer, Dietrich, Theda Skocpol, and Peter B. Evans, eds. 1985. [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521313139&id=sYgTwHQbNAAC&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&ots=Jyo8optLgc&dq=Skocpol+Rueschemeyer+Bringing+the+State+Back+In&sig=1m3dvluBo9jULIAoYBzEdhVnIeU Bringing the State Back In].

== Anarchism ==
[[Anarchism]] is when a group of people have complete [[freedom]] and do not believe in having a state at all. Anarchists are a lot like Marxists, since they do not believe that all people are equal, but they believe (opposite to Marxists) that a country can work without any organizations in it. Law and order are not necessary.

Anarchists (such as [[Bakunin]] and [[Kropotkin]] in the [[19th century]]), often want a form of Marxism but ignoring some of their rules. They want workers to manage themselves and simply get paid for what they do, rather than getting paid in [[wages]].

A '''stream''' is a natural flow of [[water]] moving across [[country]] between [[bank]]s. It is smaller than a [[river]].

The primary meaning of '''stream''' is a body of water, confined within a [[Stream bed|bed]] and banks, and having a detectable [[current (water)|current]].  Synonyms or related words include [[river]], creek, [[tributary]], run, branch, brook, bourne, wash, and [[fork]]. Navigable streams are sometimes called [[waterway]]s, though the term may apply to any size of permanent and natural water feature except [[ocean]]s.

In the [[United States]], an intermittent stream is one that only flows for part of the year and is marked on [[topographic map|topographic maps]] with a line of blue dashes and dots.  In [[desert]] areas of the [[American Southwest]], this also includes [[wash (creek)|wash]]es, which only flow after [[thunderstorm]]s or other significant [[rain]]s.  A blue-line stream is one which flows for most or all of the year and is marked on topographic maps with a solid blue line. In [[Australia]], an intermittent stream is usually called a creek, and marked on topographic maps with a solid blue line.

Generally, streams that form only during and immediately after precipitation are termed ephemeral streams.

Streams in geographic terms are awarded order designations.  A stream of the first order is a blue-line stream which does not have any other blue-line stream feeding into it.  A stream of the second order is one which is formed by the joining of two or more blue-line streams.  A third-order stream is one below the confluence of two or more second-order streams; a fourth-order stream is formed by the confluence of at least two third-order streams, and so forth.

Typically, streams are said to have a particular profile, beginning with steep [[gradient]]s, no [[flood plain]], and little shifting of [[channel]]s, eventually evolving into streams with low gradients, wide flood plains, and extensive [[meander]]s.  The initial stage is sometimes termed a "young" stream, and the later state a "mature" or "old" stream.  However, a stream may meander for some distance before falling into a "young" stream condition.

The gradient of a stream is a critical factor in determining its character, and is entirely determined by its [[base level]] of [[erosion]].  The base level of erosion is the point at which the stream either enters the ocean, a lake or pond, or enters a stretch in which it has a much lower gradient, and may be specifically applied to any particular stretch of a stream.  In geologic terms, the stream will erode down through its bed to achieve the base level of erosion throughout its course.  If this base level is low, then the stream will rapidly cut through underlying strata and have a steep gradient, and if the base level is relatively high, then the stream will form a flood plain and meanders.

When a stream flows over an especially resistant stratum and forms a [[waterfall]] or [[cascade]], or the same results because for some reason the base level of erosion suddenly drops, perhaps as a result of a fault, the resulting sudden change in stream elevation is called a nickpoint.  The stream, of course, expends [[kinetic energy]] in "trying" to eliminate the nickpoint.

Meanders are looping changes of direction of a stream.  These may be somewhat sine-wave in form.  Typically, over time, the meanders don't disappear but gradually [[migration|migrate]] downstream.  However, if some resistant material slows or stops the downstream movement of a meander, a stream may erode through the neck between two legs of a meander to become temporarily straighter, leaving behind an arc-shaped body of water termed an [[oxbow lake]] or bayou.  A [[flood]] may also result in a meander being cut through in this way.

The point of origin of a stream is often called the headwaters or source.  The entire basin drained by the stream is termed the [[watershed]].  Every watershed is made up of smaller watersheds, while most watersheds are parts of larger watersheds.  For instance, the [[Continental Divide]] in [[North America]] divides the [[Atlantic Ocean]] watershed from the [[Pacific Ocean]] watershed, but the Atlantic Ocean watershed may be first divided into the Atlantic Ocean drainage and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] drainage.  This delineation within the [[United States]] is termed the [[Eastern Divide]].  The Gulf of Mexico watershed may be divided into [[Mississippi River]] basin and a number of smaller watersheds, such as the [[Tombigbee River]] watershed.

The Mississippi River watershed includes the [[Ohio River]] watershed, which in turn includes the [[Kentucky River]] watershed, and so forth.

The point at which a stream empties into an ocean or other large body of relatively level water is termed the mouth.  There may often be an [[estuary]] or [[delta]] at the mouth.

Some streams flow underground through unconsolidated sediments or through caves.  Especially with caves, a stream may flow aboveground for part of its course, and underground for part of its course.  When a stream emerges from an underground course, it is termed a [[spring]].

The study of streams and waterways in general is known as surface [[hydrology]] and is important in [[environmental geography]] or [[environmental geology]].

[[File:Solar System explained by simpleshow foundation.webm|thumb|299x299px|A simple video explanation of the Solar System]]

The '''Solar System''' is the [[Sun]] and all the objects in [[orbit]] around it. The Sun is orbited by [[planet]]s, [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s and other things.

The Sun is a [[star]]. It contains 99.9 percent of the Solar System's [[mass]].<ref>More precisely, 99.86 of its ''known'' mass. The total mass of the bodies in the [[Oort cloud]] is not known. Jupiter and Saturn account for 90% of the remaining 0.14%. </ref> This means that it has strong [[gravity]]. The other objects are pulled into orbit around the Sun. The sun is mostly made out of hydrogen and helium.

There are eight [[planet]]s in the Solar System. From closest to farthest from the Sun, they are: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]. The first four planets are called [[terrestrial planet]]s. They are mostly made of [[Rock (geology)|rock]] and [[metal]], and they are mostly [[solid]]. The last four planets are called [[gas giant]]s. This is because they are large planets that are mostly made of [[gas]]. Even though they are made of gas, they have much more mass than the terrestrial planets.

The Solar System also contains other things.  There are [[asteroid]]s, mostly between Mars and Jupiter.  Further out than Neptune, there is the [[Kuiper belt]] and the [[scattered disc]]. These areas have [[dwarf planet]]s, including [[Pluto]]. There are thousands of very small objects in these areas. There are also comets, [[Centaur (planetoid)|centaurs]], and there is [[Cosmic dust|interplanetary dust]].

Six of the planets and three of the dwarf planets are orbited by [[Satellite (natural)|moons]]. Furthermore, [[Cosmic dust|planetary dust]] orbits the gas giants. There are many other [[Planetary system|systems]] like the Solar System in the universe. Each star has the potential to have a planetary system. There are more than 200 [[billion]] stars in the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]].

== Evolution of the Solar System ==
{{main|Formation and evolution of the Solar System}}
The formation and [[wikt:evolution|evolution]] of the Solar System began 4.6&nbsp;[[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years ago with the [[gravitation]]al collapse of a small part of a giant [[molecular cloud]].<ref>{{citation|first=Bouvier, Audrey & Wadhwa, Meenakshi 2010 |title=The age of the Solar System redefined by the oldest Pb–Pb age of a meteoritic inclusion |doi=10.1038/ngeo941|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=3|pages=637–641}}<br>Date based on oldest inclusions found to date in [[meteorite]]s, thought to be among the first solid material to form in the collapsing solar nebula.</ref>

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the centre, forming the [[Sun]], while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary [[disk]] of loose dust, out of which the [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|moons]], [[asteroid]]s, and other Solar System bodies formed.

This widely accepted model, known as the [[nebula]]r [[hypothesis]], was first developed in the 18th (1700's) century by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[geology]], and [[planetary science]]. As our knowledge of space has grown, the models have been changed to account for the new observations.

The Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are believed to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, as the [[Earth]]'s [[Moon]], may be the result of [[Giant impact hypothesis|giant collision]]s. 

Many collisions between bodies have occurred, and have been important to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets often shifted, and planets have switched places.<ref name="Gomes">{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7041/pdf/nature03676.pdf | title=Origin of the cataclysmic Late Heavy Bombardment period of the terrestrial planets | author=R.

== Earth's orbit ==
The [[Earth's orbit]] around the Sun is nearly a perfect circle, but when mapped it is found that the [[Earth]] moves around the Sun in a very slightly oval shaped, called an [[orbit|elliptical orbit]]. The other [[planet]]s in the Solar System also circle the Sun in slightly elliptical orbits. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] has a more elliptical orbit than the others, and some of the smaller objects orbit the Sun in very [[orbit|eccentric orbits]].

== Discovery and exploration ==
{{Main|History of astronomy}}
For thousands of years, people had no need for a name for the "Solar System". They thought the Earth stayed still at the center of everything ([[geocentrism]]). Although the Greek philosopher [[Aristarchus of Samos]] suggested that there was a special order in the sky,<ref>{{cite journal|title= The astronomical system of Copernicus|author=WC Rufus|journal=Popular Astronomy|volume=31|pages=510|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1923PA.....31..510R|accessdate=2009-05--09}}</ref> [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] was the first to develop a [[Mathematical model|mathematical system]] that described what we now call the "solar system". This was called a new "system of the world". In the 17th century, [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton]] began helping people understand [[physics]] more clearly. People began to accept the idea that the Earth is a planet and moves around the Sun, and that the planets are worlds with the same [[physical law]]s that control Earth. More recently, telescopes and [[space probe]]s have led to discoveries of [[mountains]] and [[Impact crater|craters]], and [[season]]al [[meteorology|meteorological]] phenomena such as [[clouds]], [[dust storm]]s and [[ice cap]]s on the other planets.

[[File:Uklad Sloneczny 2006.png|thumb|Planetary distances, not to scale]]

== The eight planets ==
In their order from the Sun:
#[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]
#[[Venus]]
#[[Earth]]
#[[Mars]]
#[[Jupiter]]
#[[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]
#[[Uranus]]
#[[Neptune]]

The planets are the biggest objects that go around Sun.  It took people many years of using [[telescope]]s to find the objects that were farthest away.  [[Planets beyond Neptune|New planets]] might still be found, and more small objects are found every year.  Most of the planets have [[Satellite (natural)|moons]] that orbit around them just as the planets orbit the Sun. There are at least 173 of these moons in the solar system.

== Dwarf planets ==
{{Main|Dwarf planet}}

[[Pluto]] had been called a planet since it was discovered in 1930, but in 2006 [[astronomer]]s meeting at the [[International Astronomical Union]] decided on the definition of a planet, and Pluto did not fit. Instead they defined a new category of [[dwarf planet]], into which Pluto did fit, along with some others. These small planets are sometimes called [[plutino]]s.

== Structure ==
There are a few main parts of the Solar System. Here they are in order from the Sun, with the planets numbered, and the [[dwarf planet]]s marked with the letters a - e.

[[File:Terrestrial planet size comparisons.jpg|thumb|The inner planets. From left to right: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], and [[Mars]]]]

=== Inner solar system ===
The first four planets closest to the Sun are called the inner planets. They are small and dense terrestrial planets, with solid surfaces. They are made up of mostly rock and metal with a distinct internal structure and a similar size. Three also have an [[atmosphere]]. The study of the four planets gives information about [[geology]] outside the Earth. Most [[asteroid]]s are also often counted with the inner planets

=== Oort Cloud === 
The [[Oort cloud]] is separate from the '''trans-Neptune region''', and much farther out. It contains the long-period [[comet]]s. 

== Ecliptic plane ==
The ''plane of the [[ecliptic]]'' is defined by the Earth's orbit around the Sun. All of the planets orbit the Sun roughly around this same [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]. The farther away from this plane a planet orbits, the more ''inclined'' is its orbit to the ecliptic. If you could look at the solar system "edge on" then all the planets would be orbiting more or less in the plane of the ecliptic.

'''Saturn''' is the sixth [[planet]] from the [[Sun]] in the [[Solar System]]. It is the second largest planet in the Solar System, after [[Jupiter]]. Like Jupiter, [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], it is a "[[gas giant]]".

Inside Saturn is probably a [[planetary core|core]] of [[iron]], [[nickel]], [[silicon]] and [[oxygen]] compounds, surrounded by a deep layer of [[metallic hydrogen]], then a layer of [[liquid]] [[hydrogen]] and liquid [[helium]] and finally, an outer [[gas]]eous layer.<ref name="Composition ref">{{cite web| url = http://www.astrophysicsspectator.com/topics/planets/GiantGaseousPlanets.html| title = Giant gaseous planets| accessdate = 2010-07-05| last=Brainerd, Jerome James 2004| publisher = The Astrophysics Spectator}}</ref>

</ref> The largest moon is [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], which is larger in volume than the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. Titan is the second-largest moon in the Solar System. The largest moon is Jupiter's moon, [[Ganymede]]. There is also a very large system of [[planetary ring|rings]] around Saturn.  These rings are made of [[ice]] with smaller amounts of [[minerals|rocks]] and dust. Saturn is about 1,400,000,000 [[kilometer|km]] (869,000,000 [[mile|mi]]) from the Sun.  Saturn takes 29.6 [[Julian year (astronomy)|years]] on Earth to revolve around the Sun.<ref name="fact"/> 

Saturn was named after the [[Roman mythology|Roman god]] [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturnus]] (called [[Kronos]] in [[Greek mythology]]).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.credoreference.com/entry/hfcwd/cronia_kronia |title=Cronia (Kronia) |first= |last= |work=Holidays, Festivals, and Celebrations of the World Dictionary |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}</ref> Saturn's symbol is ♄ which is the symbol of Saturnus' [[sickle]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Crystal |first=Ellie |title=Saturn Mythology |url=http://www.crystalinks.com/saturnmyth.html |work=Crystalinks.com |accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref>

Saturn is an [[oblate spheroid]], meaning that it is flattened at the [[Geographical pole|pole]]s, and it swells out around its [[equator]].<ref name=rgo/> The planet's equatorial [[diameter]] is {{convert|120536|km|mi|0|lk=off|abbr=on}}, while its polar diameter (the distance from the north pole to the south pole) is {{convert|108728|km|mi|0|lk=off|abbr=on}}; a 9% difference.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press_kits/cassini-arrival.pdf |title=Cassini–Huygens Saturn arrival |format=PDF |page=9 |work=Press kit June 2004| publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |accessdate=2011-06-25}}</ref> Saturn has a flattened shape; it is due to its very fast [[rotation]], rotating once every 10.8 hours.<ref name="fact"/> Saturn is the only planet in the Solar System that is less [[density|dense]] than [[water]]. Even though the planet's [[planetary core|core]] is very dense, it has a gaseous [[atmosphere]], so the average [[relative density|specific density]] of the planet is 0.69&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> (less than the density of water).

===Atmosphere===
The outer part of Saturn's atmosphere is made up of about 96% hydrogen, 3% helium, 0.4% [[methane]] and 0.01% [[ammonia]].<ref name="fact"/> There are also very small amounts of [[acetylene]], [[ethane]] and [[phosphine]].<ref name="Mira">{{cite web |url= http://www.mira.org/fts0/planets/100/text/txt002x.htm |title= Saturn |first= |last=|work=MIRA: field trips to the stars: the Solar System|year=2006 |publisher= [http://www.mira.org/ Monterey Institute of Research in Astronomy] |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref>
[[File:Saturn hexagonal north pole feature.jpg|thumbnail|right|alt=The hexagonal cloud|The north polar [[hexagon]]al cloud first found by [[Voyager 1]] and later by [[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]]]]
Saturn's [[cloud]]s show a banded pattern, like the cloud bands seen on Jupiter. Saturn's clouds are much fainter and the bands are wider at the equator. Saturn's lowest cloud layer is made up of water ice, and is about {{convert|10|km|mi|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name="Mira"/> The [[temperature]] here is quite low, at 250 [[Kelvin|K]] (-10°[[Fahrenheit|F]], -23°[[Celsius|C]]).

====Storms and spots====
Saturn's atmosphere is also known to form oval shaped clouds, similar to the clearer spots seen in Jupiter. These oval spots are cyclonic storms, the same as [[cyclone]]s seen on Earth. In 1990, the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] found a very large white cloud near Saturn's equator. Storms like the one in 1990 were known as ''[[Great White Spot]]s''. These unique storms only exist for a short time and only happen about every 30 Earth years, at the time of the summer [[solstice]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103505000308 |title=Saturn's cloud structure and temporal evolution from ten years of Hubble Space Telescope images (1994–2003) |first= |last=S.

Great White Spots were also found in 1876, 1903, 1933, and 1960.

The [[Voyager 1]] spacecraft found a [[hexagon]]al cloud pattern near Saturn's north pole at about [[longitude|78°N]]. The [[Cassini−Huygens]] probe later confirmed it in 2006. Unlike the north pole, the south pole does not show any hexagonal cloud feature. The probe also discovered a [[hurricane]]-like storm locked to the south pole that clearly showed an [[eye (cyclone)|eyewall]]. Until this discovery, eyewalls had only been seen on Earth.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10499 |title=Spectacular storm rages on Saturn's south pole  |first= Maggie|last=McKee |work=New Scientist Magazine |year=2006-11-06 |accessdate=2011-04-21}}</ref>

===Interior===
Saturn's interior is similar to Jupiter's interior. It has a small rocky core about the size of the Earth at its centre.<ref name=rgo>{{cite web |url= http://www.oarval.org/section3_11.htm |title=Saturn |first= |last= |work=Information Leaflet No. 42|publisher=[[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Greenwich Observatory]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2011-04-26}}</ref> It is very hot; its [[temperature]] reaches 15,000 [[Kelvin|K]] ({{convert|26540|F|C|0|lk=off|abbr=on}}).

===Magnetic field===
Saturn has a natural [[magnetic field]] that is weaker than Jupiter's. Like the Earth's, Saturn's field is a magnetic [[dipole]]. Saturn's field is unique in that it is perfectly symmetrical, unlike any other known planet.<ref name=sutton/> This means the field is exactly in line with the planet's [[axis of rotation|axis]].<ref name=sutton>{{cite web |url= http://books.google.com.au/books?id=oqqoUMj9-pUC&pg=PA509&lpg=PA509&dq=Saturn+symmetrical+axis&source=bl&ots=j1Gk8v8GFw&sig=6oopkQLLwSlBlHN-mLn7FAGqXCc&hl=en&ei=XZv9TcKbHoa4vwP66o2pAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CE8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Saturn yields to Voyager's brief caress |first=Christine |last=Sutton |work=New Scientist Magazine |year=1981-08-27 |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref> Saturn generates [[radio wave]]s, but they are too weak to be detected from Earth.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=A.

==Rotation and orbit==
Saturn's average distance from the Sun is over 1,400,000,000&nbsp;km (869,000,000&nbsp;mi), about nine times the distance from the Earth to the Sun. It takes 10,759 days, or about 29.7 years, for Saturn to orbit around the Sun.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nasa.gov/topics/nasalife/saturn_time.html |title=NASA image of Saturn featured in Time Magazine's 'Year in Pictures' |work=NASA in your life| publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |year=2009-12-30 |accessdate=2011-06-24}}</ref> This is known as Saturn's ''orbital period''. 

Voyager 1 measured Saturn's rotation as being 10 hours 14 minutes at the equator, 10 hours 40 minutes closer to the poles, and 10 hours 39 minutes 24 seconds for the planet's interior.<ref name=mira2>{{cite web |url= http://www.mira.org/fts0/planets/100/text/txt001x.htm#orbital |title= Saturn: orbital and rotational information |first= |last= |work=MIRA: field trips to the stars: the Solar System |publisher= Monterey Institute for Research in Astronomy|year=2006 |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> This is known as its ''rotational period''.  

Cassini measured the rotation of Saturn as being 10 hours 45 minutes 45 seconds ± 36 seconds.<ref name="SFTSRPiaP" /> That is about six minutes, or one percent, longer than the radio rotational period measured by the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft, which flew by Saturn in 1980 and 1981.

Saturn's rotational period is calculated by the rotation speed of radio waves released by the planet. The Cassini−Huygens spacecraft discovered that the radio waves slowed down, suggesting that the rotational period increased.<ref name="SFTSRPiaP">{{cite web |url= http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-062804.html |title=Scientists find that Saturn's rotation period is a puzzle |first=Carolina |last=Martinez |work=Cassini: unlocking Saturn's secrets| publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |year=2004-06-28 |accessdate=2011-06-24}}</ref> Since the scientists do not think Saturn's rotation is actually slowing down, the explanation may lie in the magnetic field that causes the radio waves.<ref name="SFTSRPiaP" />

==Planetary rings==

Saturn is best known for its [[planetary rings]] which are easy to see with a [[telescope]]. There are seven named rings; A, B, C, D, E, F, and G rings.<ref name=cosmos>{{cite journal |quotes= |last=Lovett |first=Rick |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2011 |month=June/July |title=Dance of the rings |journal=Cosmos |volume= |issue=39 |pages=57 |id= |url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/ |accessdate= 2011-06-21}}</ref> They were named in the order they were discovered, which is different to their order from the planet. From the planet the rings are: D, C, B, A, F, G and E.<ref name=cosmos/>{{rp|57}}

Scientists believe that the rings are the material left after a moon broke apart.<ref name=cosmos/>{{rp|60}} A new idea says that it was a very large moon, most of which crashed into the planet. This left a large amount of ice to form the rings, and also some of the moons, like Enceladus, which are thought to be made of ice.<ref name=cosmos/>{{rp|61}}

===History===
The rings were first discovered by [[Galileo Galilei]] in 1610, using his telescope. They did not look like rings to Galileo, so he called them "handles". He thought that Saturn was three separate planets that almost touched one another. In 1612, when the rings were facing edge on with the Earth, the rings disappeared, then reappeared again in 1613, further confusing Galileo.<ref name="history_of_the_rings">{{cite web |url= http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/saturn/back.html |title=Historical background of Saturn's rings |first=Ron |last=Baalke |work=www2.jpl.nasa.gov |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|year=2005  |accessdate=2011-07-06}}</ref> In 1655, [[Christiaan Huygens]] was the first person to recognise Saturn was surrounded by rings. Using a much more powerful telescope than Galilei's, he noted Saturn "is surrounded by a thin, flat, ring, nowhere touching...".<ref name="history_of_the_rings"/> In 1675, [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] discovered that the planet's rings were in fact made of smaller ringlets with gaps. The largest ring gap was later named the [[Rings of Saturn|Cassini Division]]. In 1859, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] showed that the rings cannot be solid, but are made of small particles, each orbiting Saturn on their own, otherwise, it would become unstable or break apart.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Extras/Maxwell_Saturn.html |title=James Clerk Maxwell on the nature of Saturn's rings |first=James Clerk |last=Maxwell |work=www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk |year=1859 |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref> [[James Keeler]] studied the rings using a [[spectrometer|spectroscope]] in 1895 which proved Maxwell's theory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sil.si.edu/DigitalCollections/HST/Huygens/huygens-introduction.htm |title=Christiaan Huygens and his Systema Saturnium |author=Brashear, Ronald |date=May 1999 |publisher= [[Smithsonian Institution]] Libraries|accessdate=2011-04-19}}</ref>

===Physical features===
The rings range from {{convert|6630|km|mi|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} to {{convert|120700|km|mi|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} above the planet's equator. As proved by Maxwell, even though the rings appear to be solid and unbroken when viewed from above, the rings are made of small particles of rock and ice. They are only about {{convert|10|m|ft|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} thick; made of [[silicon dioxide|silica]] rock, [[iron oxide]] and ice particles.<ref name=cosmos/>{{rp|55}} The smallest particles are only specks of dust while the largest are the size of a house. The C and D rings also seem to have a "wave" in them, like waves in water.<ref name=cosmos/>{{rp|58}} These large waves are {{convert|500|m|ft|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} high, but only moving slowly at about {{convert|250|m|ft|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} each day.<ref name=cosmos/>{{rp|58}} Some scientists believe that the wave is caused by Saturn's moons.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Saturn&Display=Rings |title=Saturn: Rings |first= |last= |work=Solar System exploration| publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |year=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref> Another idea is the waves were made by a [[comet]] hitting Saturn in 1983 or 1984.<ref name=cosmos/>{{rp|60}}

The largest gaps in the rings are the Cassini Division and the [[Rings of Saturn|Encke Division]], both visible from the [[Earth]]. The Cassini Division is the largest, measuring {{convert|4800|km|mi|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name="Cassini_Division">{{cite web |url= http://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/solar_system_level2/cassini_division.html |title=StarChild: Saturn's Cassini Division |work=The Solar System| publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref> However, when the Voyager spacecrafts visited Saturn in 1980, they discovered that the rings are a complex structure, made out of thousands of thin gaps and ringlets. Scientists believe this is caused by the [[gravity|gravitational force]] of some of Saturn's moons. The tiny moon [[Pan (moon)|Pan]] orbits inside Saturn's rings, creating a gap within the rings. Other ringlets keep their structure due to the gravitational force of [[shepherd satellite]]s, such as [[Prometheus (moon)|Prometheus]] and [[Pandora (moon)|Pandora]]. Other gaps form due to the gravitational force of a large moon farther away. The moon [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] is responsible for clearing away the Cassini gap.<ref name="Cassini_Division" />

Recent data from the Cassini spacecraft has shown that the rings have their own atmosphere, free from the planet's atmosphere. The rings' atmosphere is made of oxygen gas, and it is produced when the Sun's [[ultraviolet]] light breaks up the water ice in the rings. [[Chemical reaction]] also occurs between the ultraviolet light and the water [[molecule]]s, creating hydrogen gas. The oxygen and hydrogen atmospheres around the rings are very widely spaced.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4640641.stm |title=Saturn rings have own atmosphere |first=Paul |last=Rincon |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2005-07-01 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref> As well as oxygen and hydrogen gas, the rings have a thin atmosphere made of [[hydroxide]]. This [[anion]] was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2006ApJ...644L.137J&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=42bf06f4d906731%20The%20Enceladus%20and%20OH%20Tori%20at%20Saturn |title=The Enceladus and OH Tori at Saturn |first= R.E.|last=Johnson |work=SAO/NASA ADS Astronomy Abstract Service |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref>

===Spokes===

They rotate at the same time with the planet's [[magnetosphere]], therefore, it is believed that they have a connection with [[electromagnetism]]. However, what causes the spokes to form is still unknown.

==Exploration==
[[File:Saturn from Cassini Orbiter (2007-01-19).jpg|thumbnail|right|alt=Saturn from Cassini orbiter|Saturn as seen from the Cassini spacecraft in 2007]]
Saturn was first explored by the [[Pioneer 11]] spacecraft in September 1979. It flew as close as {{convert|20000|km|mi|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} above the planet's cloud tops. It took photographs of the planet and a few of its moons, but were low in [[wikt:resolution|resolution]] (the quality was not very good). It discovered a new, thin ring called the F ring. It also discovered that the dark ring gaps appear bright when viewed towards the [[Sun]], which shows the gaps are not empty of material. The spacecraft measured the temperature of the moon Titan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceprojects.arc.nasa.gov/Space_Projects/pioneer/PN10&11.html |title=The Pioneer 10 & 11 Spacecraft |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060130100401/http://spaceprojects.arc.nasa.gov/Space_Projects/pioneer/PN10&11.html|publisher=Ames Research Center, NASA |date=2005-10-08  |archivedate=2006-01-30}} Mission Descriptions.

In November 1980, Voyager 1 visited Saturn, and took higher resolution photographs of the planet, rings and moons. These photos were able to show the surface features of the moons. Voyager 1 went close to Titan, and gained much information about its atmosphere. In August, 1981, [[Voyager 2]] continued to study the planet. Photos taken by the space probe showed that changes were happening to the rings and atmosphere. The Voyager spacecrafts discovered a number of moons orbiting close to Saturn's rings, as well as discovering new ring gaps.

On July 1, 2004, the Cassini−Huygens probe entered into orbit around Saturn. Before then, it flew close to [[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]], taking very high resolution photos of its surface and collecting data. On December 25, 2004, the Huygens probe separated from the Cassini probe before moving down towards Titan's surface and landed there on January 14, 2005. It landed on a dry surface, but it found that large bodies of liquid exist on the moon. The Cassini probe continued to collect data from Titan and a number of the icy moons. It found evidence that the moon Enceladus had water erupting from its [[geyser]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2006/09mar_enceladus/ |title=Radical!

In March 2007, it discovered a large hydrocarbon lake the size of the [[Caspian Sea]] near its north pole.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6449081.stm |title=Probe reveals seas on Saturn moon |first=Paul |last=Rincon|work=BBC News |date=2007-03-14 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |location=London|accessdate=2011-06-20}}</ref>

Cassini observed [[lightning]] occurring in Saturn since early 2005. The power of the lightning was measured to be 1,000 times more powerful than lightning on Earth. Astronomers believe that the lightning observed in Saturn is the strongest ever seen.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/02/060215090726.htm |title=Astronomers find giant lightning storm at Saturn |first= |last= |work=sciencedaily.com |year=2006-02-15  |accessdate=2011-06-20}}</ref>

'''Slavery''' is an [[economy|economic system]]. In it, some people must [[Labour (economics)|work]] for no [[pay]]. It is also a system of [[ownership]].<ref name=wisTAP>{{cite web |url=http://abolition.e2bn.org/slavery_40.html |title=What is Slavery? |author= |date= |website=The Abolition Project |publisher=East of England Broadband Network and MLA East of England |accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref> In history, in many times and in many countries, [[people]] of the country owned slaves.<ref name=wisTAP/> Some of these include the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Aztec Empire|Aztecs]] and [[Inca Empire|Incas]].<ref name=wisTAP/>

There is [[evidence]] that even before there was [[writing]], there was slavery.<ref>''Tribe and Polity in Late Prehistoric Europe'', eds. D. Blair Gibson; M.N. Geselowitz (New York: Plenum Press, 1988), p. 179</ref> There have been different types of slavery, and they have been in almost all [[culture]]s and [[continent]]s.<ref name=Slavery>[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24156 Historical survey > Slave-owning societies]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica.''</ref> Some societies had laws about slavery, or they had an [[economy]] that was built on it. [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]] had many slaves.

During the 20th century almost all countries made laws forbidding slavery. The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] says that slavery is wrong. Slavery is now banned by [[international law]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/SlaveryConvention.aspx |title=Slavery Convention |author= |date= |website= |publisher=The United Nations |accessdate=4 November 2015}}</ref> Nevertheless, there are still different forms of slavery in some countries.<ref name="BBC Millions 'forced into slavery'">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2010401.stm BBC Millions 'forced into slavery']</ref>

The English word "slave" comes from the [[medieval]] word for the [[Slavic peoples]] of [[Central Europe]] and [[Eastern Europe]], because these were the last ethnic group to be captured and enslaved in [[Central Europe]].<ref>{{cite |title=slave |encyclopedia=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=slave |accessdate=26 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite |title=Merriam-Webster's |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/slave |accessdate=18 August 2009}}</ref>  According to [[Adam Smith]] and [[Auguste Comte]], a slave was mainly defined as a captive or [[prisoner of war]].  Slave-holders used to buy slaves at [[slave auction]]s. In many cases slaves are not allowed [[human rights|rights]]. 

== Early civilizations ==
In one form or another slavery has been practiced since the earliest civilizations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001337/133738e.pdf#page=9 |title=Struggles against slavery |author= |date=2004 |website= |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=4 February 2016}}, p. 44</ref> Early [[hunter-gatherer]]s had no use for slaves.<ref name=HistWld>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=cio |title=History of Slavery |author= |date= |website= |publisher=History World |accessdate=4 February 2016}}</ref> They did everything for themselves. Having another pair of hands to help them meant another mouth to feed. Slavery or owning another person made no sense to these people.<ref name=HistWld/> Once men gathered in [[cities]] and [[towns]] and there was more than enough food, having a cheap supply of labor made sense.<ref name=HistWld/> This is when the earliest forms of slavery appeared. Slavery can be traced back to the earliest records, such as the ''[[Code of Hammurabi]]'' (c. 1760&nbsp;BC). This refers to it as an established institution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MESO/CODE.HTM |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514033802/http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/MESO/CODE.HTM |archivedate=14 May 2011 |title= Mesopotamia: The Code of Hammurabi|quote=e.g. Prologue, "the shepherd of the oppressed and of the slaves" Code of Laws No. 307, "If any one buy from the son or the slave of another man".}}</ref>

In the Ancient Near East, captives obtained through warfare often became slaves. This was seen by the [[law]]s in the [[Bible]] book of  [[Deuteronomy]] as a legal form of slavery. But the [[Israelites]] were not allowed to enslave other Israelites. The Deuteronomic Code calls for the [[death penalty]] for the [[crime]] of [[kidnapping]] Israelites to enslave them.

In [[Ancient Egypt]], slaves were mainly prisoners of war. Other ways people could become slaves was by [[Inheritance|inheriting]] the status from their parents who were slaves. Someone could become a slave if he could not pay his [[debt]]s. People also sold themselves into slavery because they were poor [[peasant]]s and needed [[food]] and [[shelter]]. The lives of slaves were normally better than that of peasants.<ref name="touregypt1">{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/slaves.htm |title=Slaves and Slavery in Ancient Egypt |publisher=Touregypt.net |date=2011-10-24 |accessdate=2015-10-18}}</ref> Young slaves could not be put to hard work, and had to be brought up by the mistress of the [[household]]. Not all slaves went to houses. Some also sold themselves to [[temple]]s, or were assigned to temples by the [[king]]. Slave trading was not very popular until later in Ancient Egypt. Afterwards, slave trades sprang up all over Egypt.

== Slavery in ancient Rome ==
Roman slaves played an important [[role]] in [[society]] and the economy. Besides manual labor, slaves performed many [[Domestic worker|domestic services]]. They could work at highly skilled jobs and [[profession]]s. [[Teacher]]s, [[accountant]]s, and [[physician]]s were often slaves. [[Greece|Greek]] slaves were often [[Education|highly educated]]. Unskilled slaves, or those sentenced to slavery as [[punishment]], worked on [[farm]]s, in [[Mining|mine]]s, and at [[mill (grinding)|mill]]s. Their living conditions were brutal, and their lives short.

Slaves were considered property under [[Roman law]] and had no legal personhood. Unlike [[Roman citizen]]s, they could be subjected to corporal punishment, [[Sexual abuse|sexual exploitation]] ([[prostitute]]s were often slaves), [[torture]], and [[Execution|summary execution]]. The testimony of a slave could not be accepted in a court of law unless the slave was tortured—a practice based on the belief that slaves in a position to be privy to their masters' affairs would be too virtuously loyal to reveal damaging evidence unless coerced. Over time, however, slaves gained increased legal protection, including the right to file complaints against their masters. Attitudes changed in part because of the influence among the educated elite of the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], whose [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] views of humanity extended to slaves.

Roman slaves could hold [[property]] which, even though it belonged to their [[wikt:master|master]]s, they were allowed to use as if it were their own. Skilled or educated slaves were allowed to earn their own [[money]]. With enough money they could buy their freedom.<ref>Dennis P. Kehoe,''The Oxford Handbook of Social Relations in the Roman World'' (London; New York: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 147–148</ref>

== The Arab slave trade ==
{{main|Arab slave trade}}
Historians estimate that between 650 [[AD]] and the 1960s, 10 to 18 million people were enslaved by Arab slave traders. They were taken from Europe, Asia and Africa across the [[Red Sea]], [[Indian Ocean]], and [[Sahara]] desert. Male slaves were often employed as [[servant]]s, [[soldier]]s, or workers by their owners. Most male slaves were [[Castration|castrated]].<ref name=MooreABS>{{cite web |url=http://atlantablackstar.com/2014/06/02/10-facts-about-the-arab-enslavement-of-black-people-not-taught-in-schools/ |title=10 Facts About The Arab Enslavement Of Black People Not Taught In Schools |author=A. Moore |date=2 June 2014 |website= |publisher=Atlanta Black Star |accessdate=30 January 2016}}</ref> It is estimated that as many as 6 out of every 10 boys [[Bleeding|bled]] to death during the process.<ref name=MooreABS/> But the high price of [[Eunuch]]s made it worthwhile. Woman and children taken as slaves were mainly used as servants and [[Concubinage|concubines]]. While the later Atlantic slave trade concentrated on men for labor, the Arab slave trade started with men and boys, but shifted over time to concentrate more on woman and young girls for [[sex]]ual purposes.

== The Atlantic slave trade ==

For four [[centuries]], beginning in the late [[15th century]], [[million]]s of [[Africa]]ns were taken as slaves by [[Europe|European]]s.<ref name=EM>{{cite web |url=https://mondediplo.com/1998/04/02africa |title=The impact of the slave trade on Africa |author=Elikia M’bokolo |date= |website= |publisher=Le Monde diplomatique |accessdate=4 November 2015}}</ref> The Europeans were not the first to exploit Africa for manpower.

Between 1452 and 1455, [[Pope Nicolas V]] issued a series of [[papal bull]]s authorizing the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] to take African slaves.<ref name=LDL>{{cite web |url=http://ldhi.library.cofc.edu/exhibits/show/african_laborers_for_a_new_emp/pope_nicolas_v_and_the_portugu |title=African Laborers for a New Empire: Iberia, Slavery, and the Atlantic World |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Lowcountry Digital Library |accessdate=4 November 2015}}</ref> At first slave traders raided costal areas and carried black people off. But the mines and fields of the colonies needed more and more slaves. In the early 16th century Spain began to issue [[license]]s and [[contract]]s to suply slaves. By the 1750s large slaving companies were established. Most of Europe at the time was involved in the slave trade.<ref name=LDL/>

== Slavery in the Americas ==
Many [[Europe|European]]s who arrived in [[North America]] during the [[17th century|17th]] and [[18th century|18th centuries]] came under contract as [[indentured servant]]s.<ref>[http://mertsahinoglu.com/research/indentured-servitude-colonial-america/ Indentured Servitude in Colonial America]. Deanna Barker, ''Frontier Resources''.</ref> The change from indentured servitude to slavery was a gradual process in Virginia. The earliest legal documentation of such a shift was in 1640. This is where a negro, [[John Punch (slave)|John Punch]], was sentenced to lifetime slavery for attempting to run away. This case also marked the disparate treatment of [[Africa]]ns as held by the Virginia County Court, where two [[Caucasian|white]] runaways received far lesser sentences.<ref>{{Cite book |title=In the Matter of Color: Race and the American Legal Process: The Colonial Period |first=A.

They kept their servants as slaves for life. This was demonstrated by the case Johnson v. Parker. The court ruled that [[John Casor]], an indentured servant, be returned to Johnson who claimed that Casor belonged to him for his life.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=History of Black Americans: From Africa to the emergence of the cotton kingdom |first=Philip S. |last=Foner |publisher=Oxford University Press  |year=1980 |url=http://testaae.greenwood.com/doc_print.aspx?fileID=GR7529&chapterID=GR7529-747&path=books/greenwood}}</ref><ref>[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1993/1/1993_1_90.shtml Selling Poor Steven].

== Slavery today ==
Millions of people are still slaves in some parts of the world, mostly in [[South Asia]] and [[Africa]]. It is less common in the [[First World|developed world]] because of better [[law enforcement]], but it still happens there as well. <ref name="BBC Millions 'forced into slavery'"/> The ways in which it is done have changed. Today, slaves may work because of things like a high [[debt]] (for example, slaves have to work to pay off a debt). Many victims are told that their families will be harmed if they report the slave owners. Many slaves are forced to be domestic servants. In some cases, their families sell them to the slave owners. Some slaves have been trafficked from one part of the world to another. These people are illegally in their host country, and therefore do not report the abuse. Forced [[prostitution]] is a type of slavery. Another form of slavery still happening today is forced [[child labor]]. Some children have to work in [[Mining|mines]] or in [[plantation]]s, or they have to fight wars as [[child soldier]]s, for no pay. 

One study says that there are 27 million people (but others say there could be as many as 200 million) in slavery today.<ref>Kevin Bales, ''Disposable People''</ref>

Other terms that describe the recruitement of laborers, and that may have similarities to slavery are [[Blackbirding]], [[Impressment]] and [[Shanghaiing]].

== Stopping slavery ==
An agitation called [[Abolitionism]] against slavery began in Christian countries in the 18th century. First they abolished the [[slave trade]] so more people wouldn't become slaves. In 1833, the [[British Empire]] stopped slavery. Several other countries followed. In the [[United States]], disagreement over slavery led to the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. In 1865, when the North won, all slaves were made free. Still more countries abolished slavery afterwards. [[Pedro II of Brazil]] abolished it in 1888. Forced labor however continued, either against the law or by debt [[peon]]age or other methods which the laws of the various countries did not count as slavery.

[[Category:Slavery|*]]{{for|the music genre|Soul music}}
Many [[philosophy|philosophies]] and [[religion]]s say that a '''soul''' is the part of a [[life|living]] [[human being]] which is [[supernatural]] and lives after [[human death|death]]. It cannot be discovered by science, because it cannot be tested in any controlled way. Many different opinions exist as to what happens to personal [[experience]] after death. Most [[Atheism|atheists]] say that there is no such thing as a soul, and that the body is the only part of a person.

== Popular culture ==
In popular culture, soul usually means deep feeling and commitment. It is in this sense that the word appears in the term [[soul music]]. However that music was also influenced by [[gospel music]] which was religious.

One popular idea about souls that is easy to express, is that a person ''is'' a soul, and ''has'' a body.<ref>Miller, Walter M. Jr. (1960). ''A Canticle for Leibowitz.''</ref> The soul is the "I" in "I exist" that feels and lives life. What people call the [[mind]] could be ''part'' of the soul: one soul started this article, other souls have edited it, and another soul is reading it. This view, however, implies that the [[human body]] is a possession, and seems to devalue bodies that do not have souls as defined or understood by the speaker (some people say that [[animal]]s, [[heretic]]s, and people of another [[religion]] do not have souls). Like most uses of the verb [[to be]], there is an ideology in these simple words.

Christianity teaches that all humans have an immortal soul.<ref name=mayled>{{cite book|title=GCSE Religious Studies: Philosophy and Applied Ethics for OCR B: Revision Guide|first=Jon|last=Mayled|publisher=Hodder Education|date=2010|page=17|isbn=978-1-444-11071-5}}</ref> This means that it is a part of them which does not die when their physical body dies, but lives on with them to [[heaven]] or to [[hell]]. Christians believe that the soul is the 'breath of life' which God gave to Adam.<ref name=mayled />

In [[Japan]] the soul is believed to weigh 21 grams. This belief may have been influenced by the observations of [[:en:Duncan MacDougall (doctor)|Dr. McDougall]] in the early 1900s.{{cn|date=June 2013}} <!-- citation needed tag includes both sentences -->

=== Characteristics ===
One distinction often made is between soul, which is distinct from other souls, and [[spirit]] which may be combined with that of other beings. The idea of the [[Holy Spirit]] in [[Christianity]], for example, is a universal and shared spirit many souls are part of, and which is expressed on Earth in that faith by "the Church" meaning "the body of Christ" meaning "all bodies that follow Jesus." This could be more inclusive than the is/has view of souls and bodies.

== Reincarnation ==
[[Reincarnation]] is a belief that says that after the body dies, the soul will be born again in another body.

[[Category:Theology]][[File:Tualetsapo.jpg|thumb|right|A bar of soap]]
'''Soap''' is a [[chemical compound]] resulting from the reaction of an alkali (commonly sodium or potassium hydroxide) with a fatty acid. When mixed with [[water]] during [[bath]]ing or [[washing]], they help people and clothes get [[hygiene|clean]] by lowering the chance of [[dirt]] and [[oil]] to get to the skin or [[fabric]]. Soaps are made from [[animal]] [[fat]]s or [[vegetable]] [[oil]]s. There are two basic steps in making soap. They are called Saponification and Salting-out of soap.

Soap cleans very well in [[soft water]]. It is not [[Toxicity|toxic]] to water life. It can be broken down by [[bacteria]]. However, it is slightly [[Solubility|soluble]] in water, so it is not often used in [[washing machine]]s. It does not work well in [[hard water]]. It cannot be used in strongly [[acid]]ic [[solution]]s. Hand soaps are only acidic enough to remove unwanted skin oils. For other forms of oil, Dishwashing soap is acidic enough to remove almost all forms of oil without damaging other petrolium products such as Plastic. It does not damage skin either.
Soap are the metallic salts of long chain fatty acids. 

Many soap experts say that soap can be made in many ways. Humanity has used soap-like things for at least 4000 [[year]]s. The earliest recorded evidence of the making of soap-like materials dates back to around 2800 BC in Ancient [[Babylon]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Willcox | first = Michael | editor = Hilda Butler | title = Poucher's Perfumes, Cosmetics and Soaps | edition = 10th edition | year = 2000 | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | location = Dordrecht | pages = 453 | chapter = Soap | quote =The earliest recorded evidence of the production of soap-like materials dates back to around 2800 BCE in ancient Babylon.}}</ref> A recipe for soap having [[water]], [[alkali]] and [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cassia]] oil was written on a Babylonian clay tablet around 2200 BC. 

The [[Ebers papyrus]] (Egypt, 1550 BC) suggests that [[ancient Egypt]]ians bathed commonly and had animal and vegetable oils with alkaline [[salt]]s to make a soap-like substance. Egyptian [[wikt:document|documents]] say that a soap-like substance was used in the preparation of [[wool]] for [[weaving]].

A '''summary''' is a short [[version]] of something, for instance a [[movie]] or a [[book]] or an [[newspaper|article]]. It tells you the main things in the movie or article or book in a short way and leaving out the [[wikt:detail|detail]]s (the less important things). 
Many [[science|scientific]] [[journal]]s [[Publishing|publish]] a summary for every large article so people who do not have much time can read the main information quickly without spending too much time reading the article.

[[category:Writing]]A '''service''' is a job or work done for someone else. All the service trades in a place form a '''service economy'''.  The service economy can be in a region like a country or in a town or city.

== Structure ==
Often, the person who gives the service will get something in return for the service. The person who gives the service can get money in return. The person who gives the service can get goods in return. The person who gives the service can get another service in return. This is a type of [[trade]].

[[Category:Economics]]There are several meanings of the word '''sense'''.  This page is for [[wikipedia:disambiguation|disambiguation]] - there are more detailed articles on each meaning:

When a word has several meanings, one can refer to it as being used "in the sense of..." some context or other.  In [[Basic English|Simple English]] for instance we avoid using words in unusual senses.

== The sensory system of animals ==
The human [[sensory system]] is usually said to have six senses:
*[[Hearing]] is the sense of sound that comes into our [[ear]]s. 
*[[Sight]] is the sense of seeing things with our [[eye]]s.  
*[[Touch]] is the sense of feeling things with our [[skin]].  
*[[Taste]] is the sense of the flavor of things with our [[tongue]]s
*[[Olfaction|Smell]] is the sense of smelling things with our [[nose]]s.  
*[[Kinesthetic]] sense is knowing where your whole [[body]] is and where it is not.
Other animals may have other senses. [[Fish]] have [[lateral line]]s which detect changes in the water pressure around them, and some can detect changes in [[electric field]]s around them.

== Sense in language ==
Sense in this context is the [[wikt:meaning|meaning]] conveyed by language. 

Another use is to flag whether an [[argument]] or [[statement]] is correct and understood.  "That makes '''no sense'''" or "That is '''nonsense'''" are examples from everyday [[speech]].  

A variation of this is to say that something does not make "[[economic sense]]".  Usually these words signal a [[political]] [[dispute]] or some failure to define terms correctly.

The term "[[common sense]]" is thinking based on a wide experience of life. It used to mean practical [[wikt:wisdom|wisdom]]. It has a long history of being used in [[politics]], often to mean that some idea will be accepted or rejected because of [[human nature]] (what people are like).

[[File:Great Synagogue Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|220px|right|The Great Synagogue in Jerusalem]]
A '''synagogue''' is a place where [[Judaism|Jews]] meet to [[worship]] and [[pray]] to [[God]].

In [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a synagogue is called ''beit knesset'', which means, a "house of gathering". The word "synagogue" comes from ''sunagoge'', which is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word. In a synagogue, Jews carry out the [[Jewish services]], which consist of prayers, sometimes with special actions.

A synagogue will usually have a large room for prayers. There might be some smaller rooms for studying. There will be some offices. There will also usually be a big room for special events. 

The front of a synagogue faces towards [[Jerusalem]] in [[Israel]].  In the front is the holiest part of the synagogue, the [[Ark]]. This is a closet which has the [[Torah]] scrolls inside.  The Torah scrolls have the holy writings of Judaism on them.  The Ark usually has a curtain in front of it.

On top of the Ark is light which is always lit, called the “[[Eternal Lamp]]”. It is a symbol which means that God is always there.
Every synagogue has a raised platform called the “[[Bimah]]”. The person who reads the Torah scroll stands there when he reads. The Bimah is either in the middle of the hall, or in front of the Ark.

In some synagogues men and women sit in different places. Some synagogues even have a short wall so that they can not see each other. This is so that the people will think about the prayers better.

Jews may call synagogues by different names. Many [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] Jews living in [[English language|English]]-speaking countries use the name "synagogue" or the word "shul.", which is [[Yiddish]]. Jews who speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] call synagogues ''esnoga''. Some Jews call the synagogue a [[temple]]. 

Jewish worship does not have to be carried out in a synagogue.  It can be wherever a [[minyan]] of ten Jews are. It could be in someone's home or anywhere such as a cruise liner or an airplane  Some synagogues have a separate room or torah study, this is called the beth midrash meaning house of study.  Some kinds of Jewish worship can be done alone or with fewer than ten people.

<!-- interwiki -->'''Scarcity''' in [[economics]] is used to describe the lack of various forms of [[capital (economics)|capital]].  Scarcity can be used to describe an economic [[situation]] in economics, or it can be used to describe more general situations.

In economics, scarcity is the result of [[wikt:people|people]] having "Unlimited Wants and Needs," or always wanting something new, and having "Limited [[Resource]]s." Limited Resources means that there are never enough resources, or [[material]]s, to [[satisfaction|satisfy]], or fulfill, the wants and needs that every person have. Scarcity is called the "basic economic problem," meaning that is always [[existence|exists]].

Scarcity exists due to the effects of [[nature]] such as [[drought]], [[flood]]s, storms, pest infestation, [[fire]] and other things.  Real scarcity can also exist by over use of non-renewable resources.  Goods (things) and [[service]]s are also scarce because there are only a [[Constraint|limited]] [[number]] of things in the [[world]] and due to the limits of [[technology]] and our own [[priority|priorities]].

[[Category:Microeconomics]]'''Textual difficulty''' means how easy or hard a text is to read. Research has shown that two main factors affect the ease with which texts are read.<ref name=Klare>[[George R. Klare|Klare G.R.]] 1963. ''The measurement of readability''. Iowa State University Press, Ames IA.</ref>
#How difficult the words are: this is ''[[Lexicon|lexical]]'' difficulty. Rare words are less well known than common words. Rare, difficult words are often longer than common, easy words. 
#How difficult the sentences are: this is ''[[Syntax|syntactical]]'' difficulty. Long, complicated sentences cause more difficulty than short, [[simple sentence]]s.

== Readability predictions ==
A '''readability test''' is a way to measure a text for how easy it is to read. Readability tests give a [[prediction]] as to how difficult readers will find a particular text. They do this by measuring one or both of the two main causes, as follows:

=== Word difficulty ===
Word difficulty is usually measured by vocabulary lists or word length. 
In 1923, Bertha A. Lively and [[Sidney L. Pressey]] published the first reading ease  formula. They had been concerned that science textbooks in junior high school had so many technical words. They felt that teachers spent all class time explaining their meaning. They argued that their formula would help to measure and reduce the “vocabulary burden” of textbooks. Their formula used the [[Thorndike]] word list as a basis.<ref>Thorndike E.L. 1921 ''The teacher's word book''. 1932 ''A teacher's word book of the twenty thousand words found most frequently and widely in general reading for children and young people''. 1944 (with J.E. Lorge) ''The teacher's word book of 30,000 words''.</ref> Manually, it took three hours to apply the formula to a book.<ref name="Lively">Lively, Bertha A. and Pressey S.L. 1923. A method for measuring the 'vocabulary burden' of textbooks. ''Educational administration and supervision'' '''9''':389–398.</ref>

==== Vocabulary lists ==== 
Several [[vocabulary]] lists have been published by researchers. These lists are based on samples of published texts in English, and (less often) samples of recorded spoken language. The lists differ slightly according to the sources chosen, but they are very reliable.<ref>In this context, 'reliable' means something like: if the research was repeated, you would get a very similar result.</ref><ref>500 most common words: [http://www.world-english.org/english500.htm]</ref><ref>Top 1000 words: [http://www.bckelk.ukfsn.org/words/uk1000n.html]</ref> The items listed may represent more than one actual word; they are [[Lemma (linguistics)|lemma]]s. For instance the entry "be" contains within it the occurrences of "is", "was", "be" and "are".<ref name=langlog> Benjamin Zimmer: [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003274.html Time after time after time...] Language Log. Retrieved 22 June 2006. </ref> The top 100 lemmas account for 50% of all the words in the Oxford English Corpus.<ref name=langfacts> [http://www.askoxford.com/oec/mainpage/oec02/?view=uk AskOxford.com: Language Facts]. Retrieved 22 June 2006. </ref>

''The Reading Teachers Book of Lists'' claims that the first 25 words make up about one-third of all printed material in English, and that the first 100 make up about one-half of all written material.<ref>First 100 words: [http://www.duboislc.org/EducationWatch/First100Words.html]</ref>

One of the first readability tests, the [[Dale–Chall formula]], used a vocabulary list. It counted the number of listed words in a passage, and applied a [[formula]] which gave a [[grade level]]. It was used to rate textbooks for grade levels in US school districts.

It is easy, in principle, to use a vocabulary list as part of a computer-based readability measure. The list is organised as a [[look-up table]]. The [[percentage]] of listed words in a passage gives the data for the formula, and the user is presented with a grade level.

==== Word length ====
This is called an ''index'', or a ''proxy''.<ref>A proxy is one person or thing standing for another.</ref> This is because word length is [[correlation|correlated]] with word [[frequency]], and word frequency is correlated with word difficulty. ''Longer words are, ''on average'', harder than short words''. 

Word length is measured by counting the letters in each word, or by counting [[syllable]]s. Since most syllables have one [[vowel]], some computer programs count vowels per average word. A few tests measure the percentage of words on a list; the list is based on the known frequency of words in a language.

=== Sentence difficulty ===
Sentence difficulty is usually measured by sentence length. This again is an index, because longer sentences are, on average, harder than short sentences. Computers count the number of words between full stops, but this is a second-best method. Humans can judge whether a semi-colon or colon should count as the end of a sentence for testing purposes.

Since both factors may vary independently of each other, the best prediction is gained by devising a formula with makes use of both indices. What this means is that a single score is produced for a text, and that score is looked up on a table or graph. That tells you how difficult the text is in terms of either a) an American school grade level, or b) an artificial scale of 0% to 100%. Either way is effective. What really makes a difference is:
*Methods using both indices are more reliable than methods using only one index.<ref name=Klare/>

== Direct measurement ==
It is possible to get a good prediction by getting a group of subjects to read through a passage, followed by multiple-choice questions. Even better is a method called '''cloze''', where subjects fill in blanks on a text they have not seen before. The percentage of correctly completed blanks is an outstandingly good predictor of text difficulty.<ref>Taylor W.L. 1953. Cloze procedure: a new tool for measuring readability. ''Journalism Quarterly'', '''30''', 415-433.</ref>

Naturally, this kind of direct measure requires subjects, and a skilled experimenter. It also requires the prior preparation of texts suitable for the chosen sample of subjects. The method is therefore too expensive for widespread use.

== Types of tests ==
{{see also|List of readability tests}}

A person can perform readability tests himself by [[counting]] and doing some [[math]], or by using word-processing software. 

=== Tests on subjects ===
* Multiple-choice questions
* Cloze test

=== Test on texts ===
==== Two-variable formulae ====
* [[Dale–Chall readability formula]]
* [[Flesch Reading Ease]] (Flesch Readability Test)
** Flesch–Kincaid Reading Level (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Index)
* [[Fry readability formula]]

* [[Gunning Fog Index]]

Assessment of online patient materials for breast reconstruction. ''Journal of Surgical Research''. [http://www.journalofsurgicalresearch.com/article/S0022-4804(15)00501-6/abstract]</ref>

Their summary was: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2015-06-24/Recent_research#cite_ref-3]
:"The authors concluded that the readability of online patient information for ‘[[liposuction]]’ and ‘[[breast reconstruction]]’ is ‘too difficult’ for many patients as the readability scores of all 20 websites (10 each) far exceeds that of a 6th-grade reading level. The average score for the most popular ‘liposuction’ websites was determined equal to 13.6-grade level. As a comparison ‘tattoo information’ scored at the 7.8-grade level".

:"Health care information available at the most popular websites for ‘breast reconstruction’ had an average readability score of 13.4, with 100% of the top 10 websites providing content far above the recommended 6th grade reading level. Wikipedia.org readability scores aligned at the higher readability range for both terms, with scores above the 14 grade level for ‘liposuction’, and above grade 15 for ‘breast reconstruction’".

That shows these articles, and presumably many other medical articles on English wiki, are written in prose far too difficult for the average member of the public.

'''Theatre''' (British English and also American English), or '''Theater''' (mostly American English), has several meanings.

The word comes originally from the Greek ''Theatron'', meaning roughly, 'a place to behold'. In American English, the word 'theater' can mean either a place where films are shown (this is also called a [[cinema]]) or a place where live stage plays are performed.<ref>Brown, John Russell. 1997.'' What is theatre?: an introduction and exploration''. Boston and Oxford: Focal P. ISBN 978-0-240-80232-9</ref> In British English, 'theatre' means a place where live [[Play (theatre)|plays]] are performed.  Some people, both English and American, use the spelling 'theatre' to mean a place where live plays are performed, and the spelling 'theater' to mean a cinema.

'Theatre' can also mean the business of putting on plays. An actor might say "I am in the theatre business", or a writer might say "I write for the theatre", meaning that they write plays, rather than writing for movies or television shows.<ref>Banham, Martin, ed. 1998.

=== Ancient Greece ===
:''Main article: [[Theatre of Ancient Greece]]''
The first people we know created plays were the Ancient Greeks, about the year 500 B.C. They divided plays into two kinds: [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]]. This division is still used today. The best known Ancient Greek writers of plays are [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], [[Euripides]] and [[Aristophanes]]. Some of their plays survived, and are still performed today. 

These ancient Greek plays were performed outdoors in large amphitheatres, so that many people could see them. There were contests among the playwrights (people who write plays are called playwrights) and the winner would get a prize.

The Greeks were full of brilliant ideas. They used mechanical devices like trap doors and the ''machina'': a crane for winching gods on and off the stage (hence 'Deus ex machina'). They had a ''Greek chorus'' that offered information to help the audience follow the performance. The chorus comments on themes, and shows how an audience might react to the drama. The players wore [[mask]]s. Illustrations on vases show helmet-like masks, covering the entire face and head, with holes for the eyes and a small aperture for the mouth, plus a wig. The mask was to ‘melt’ into the face and allow the actor to vanish into the role. Therefore, onlookers did not think about the actor, but thought about the character.

=== Middle Ages ===
In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Catholic]] [[church]] began to use theatre as a way of telling the stories from the [[Bible]] to people who did not know how to read. They wrote [[Mystery Plays]], where each part of the Bible story would be a play put on by a different group of people. They also wrote Miracle Plays which were plays about the lives of the saints. There were also Morality plays which taught the audiences how to live a good Christian life.

=== Commedia dell'arte plays ===
[[File:Harlekin Columbine Tivoli Denmark.jpg|thumb|Harlequine and Columbine]]
In the 1500s, groups of [[actor]]s who would tour around Italy performing comic plays to entertain townspeople. These plays were called [[Commedia dell'arte]], and different stories would be created around the same group of characters. Often the spoken lines would be made up by the actors for each performance.

Other kinds of plays called Neoclassical Dramas and Neoclassical Comedies were also popular in Italy and in France at this time. These plays were written to copy the style of the plays from Ancient Greece and Rome.

=== Elizabethan theatre ===
At the end of the sixteenth century (before 1600), the traveling actors began to perform in fixed theatre buildings. This was the period when [[William Shakespeare]] wrote. He lived from 1564 to 1616. At that time, in England, women were not allowed to perform, so male actors would play female characters. 

His theatre was in London, England. It was called The Globe. It was an outdoor theatre and plays were performed in the daytime for large audiences. His plays were very popular and many are still performed today. Many people believe Shakespeare was one of the best playwrights (a writer of plays). 

He wrote many kinds of plays: tragedies, comedies, romances and also history plays. All of his plays are written in beautiful, poetic language. Many of the plays were set in exotic, far-away places that would be interesting to London audiences. His plays are still popular today for many reasons. His characters (the people in his plays) are interesting and talk about interesting ideas. 

The stories he tells in his plays are often exciting, very funny (in the comedies), or very sad (in the tragedies) and make you want to know what happens to his characters. He says much about things we still think about today, like love, sadness, hope, pride, hatred, jealousy, and foolishness.
[[File:Zoffany-Garrick & Cibber in Venice Preserved.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Famous actors of the 1700s, David Garrick and Susannah Cibber in ''Venice Preserved''.]]

Plays including Shakespeare's were banned during [[the Protectorate']]. After that, many more were written and acted.

=== Plays from the 1900s ===
After World War II, playwrights in Europe and the United States began doing plays in a new style called "Theatre of the Absurd." After seeing the horrors of war, these playwrights felt that all their old values had been destroyed. Playwrights such as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Eugène Ionesco]], [[Harold Pinter]], and [[Jean Genet]] wrote plays that are considered to be "Theatre of the Absurd." 

The "Theatre of the Absurd" plays have some of the same ideas that are found in the [[philosophy]] (a way of thinking) called [[existentialism]]. Existentialism is very different from many other ''philosophies''. Most religions and philosopies say that human life has a meaning (or a purpose). The philosophy of existentialism is that human life does not have a meaning (or a purpose). When something has no meaning, it is "absurd". (absurd means means silly and meaningless.)

The plays written in this style make people think about questions like "what is it like to be a person in the world?" and "what does it mean for a person to be free?" They are often filled with sad emotions, such as worry, fear, and thoughts about death.

Theatre breaks are a form of short holiday, based around viewing a theatrical convention show. Theatre breaks tend to include a nights hotel accommodation included in the price.

[[Category:Theater| ]][[File:Test (student assessment).jpeg|thumb|Students working on a test.]]

A '''test''' is a way of checking something to see if it is true, or false, or if it is edible or not. If something can be tested, or finishes the tests correctly, it is testable. The ''Concise Oxford English Dictionary'' defines a test as: "a procedure intended to establish the quality, performance, or reliability of something".<ref>{{cite book|title=Concise Oxford English Dictionary|edition=Twelfth|date=2011|page=1490|first1=Angus|last1=Stevenson|first2=Maurice|last2=Waite|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-960108-0}}</ref>

A test is different from an [[experiment]]: Before a test is done, there is an [[expected value|expected result]]. The test is performed, to show this result. In an experiment, the outcome is open. Very often, tests are performed as part of an experiment.

==Products==
Products are usually tested for quality, and so that many customers will get the best products.

==People==
[[wikt:people|People]] are tested to see what they have learned. This is often called an [[wikt:assessment|assessment]] or [[examination]]. In [[learning]], a test item is a [[question]], or set of questions.

Many people think tests are valuable. They believe tests:
* are a quick and fair way of judging a test taker's performance
* enable predictions about test takers to be made
* allow selection
* improve performance by highlighting areas that need work.

However, academic tests are not perfect measures. The educator [[Salman Khan (educator)|Salman Khan]] said this about tests in his 2012 book ''The One World Schoolhouse: Education Reimagined'':<ref>{{cite book|url=https://docs.google.com/a/nu.edu.pk/viewer?a=v&q=cache:mNZ4c51O_D0J:emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/The-One-World-Schoolhouse-Salman-Khan.pdf+&hl=en&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESg0LadSOu_A7bPvWpBKiBEt9ZAQdUmH09kekpkIqrzjX4OmdStDO2VVeTKdEesvhvtbEG1bFPG_qk6fvGcrtf3qks6P4LuBkbj97PeiYT9N3X99wxkVpm2NE_bo95vU6WJEdpMD&sig=AHIEtbS6BavDm_U4gRJuxHFMJxhYCXitqg|isbn=9781444755770|title=The One World Schoolhouse: Education Reimagined|publisher=Hodder & Stoughton|first=Salman|last=Khan|page=92|date=2012}}</ref>

<blockquote>Tests measure the ''approximate'' state of a student’s memory and ''perhaps'' understanding, in regard to a particular subset of subject matter at a given moment in time, it being understood that the measurement can vary considerably and randomly according to the particular questions being asked.</blockquote>

[[wikt:people|People]] and animals can also be tested for illnesses. For example, a blood test can be used to check for [[disease]].

Rarely, people use "tests" to check people's hearts. For instance, in a famous rap song, in Korea, the lyrics were about a boyfriend, telling his girlfriend, "I'm sorry, but I must tell you we have to break up. I do not love you, I have to tell you. Forgive me, but I have to tell you. It's all a test." - Many people accuse this theory as an "excuse to be offensive" or an "excuse to break up with his girlfriend", so it does not count very ''logically'' in the "test" page.

==Science==
In [[science]], tests are called [[experiment]]s. These are done to check for a presence of a substance, or to check the quality of the thing being tested.

==Software==
In [[software engineering]], a test is used to determine a characteristic of a [[software]] system. Software is tested before it is released. ''Alpha'' testing is where software developers check the software for [[Software bug|bugs]]. Software can also be checked for quality and [[usability]]. ''Beta'' testing is done by groups of users.

==Vehicles==
[[Cars]] and other vehicles are tested using a '''crash test'''. The car is put under severe conditions to see what will make it fail. Other [[machines]] can also be crash tested. Crash test dummies stand in for humans. They 'sit' in the car seat to see if a human in the crash would have been injured or killed.

==Other==
The '''River Test''' is a chalk stream in the south of England. The river is used a lot for [[trout]] [[fishing]]. The river starts near Overton, in [[Hampshire]] and ends at the sea at the head of [[Southampton]] Water.

Sometimes, though perhaps not often, [[police]] officers use "tests" to find out [[criminals]], by measuring their [[pulse]] or [[heartbeat]] when asking questions.

[[Category:Basic English 850 words]]A '''time horizon''' is a [[future]] point in [[time]] when something must be "done" (a "[[deadline]]") or will be "over" (a "[[time limit]]").  Either way, the matter will be closed when the time horizon is reached.

Common time [[horizon]]s people use are:
*''end of [[day]], usually meaning the working day;
*''the [[weekend]]'';
*''end of [[month]];
*''[[fiscal quarter]]'';
*''end of [[school]] term;
*''end of [[calendar]] [[year]]'' 
*and ''end of [[fiscal year]]''.

It is very important to know at what time horizon something you are doing will be scored, evaluated, marked or paid for.

[[Sport]]s, for example [[football (soccer)]] and [[basketball]], often have time limits. [[Baseball]] and others do not, which sometimes causes problems.

{{science-stub}}

[[Category:Time]]A '''time limit''' is a [[time horizon]] that is imposed on everyone at once. 

It may be used to try to achieve [[fairness]] in some system of [[ethics]].  For instance, if poor people and rich people are debating something, a time limit may be imposed so that the rich people cannot keep debating until the poor people have to go to work, and lose.

Time limits are very important in [[accounting]] so that everyone can report their results (for [[tax]] and [[investment]] [[wikt:purpose|purposes]]) at the same time.  This in turn creates [[deadline]]s for the [[accountant]] and those reporting.

However, the deadline is imposed by an [[authority]], whereas the time limit is imposed by a system.  So there can be [[slack]] in a deadline, so that results do not have to be reported always very fast.

For example, in the [[United States|United States of America]], the [[end of the calendar year]] on [[December 31]] is the time limit for taxes, but the [[deadline]] for reporting is [[April 15]].  Sometimes the government allows more time, as it did for the families of those who were killed in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].

'''Taiwan''' (also known as '''Formosa''') officially the Republic of China (ROC; Chinese: 中華民國; pinyin: Zhōnghuá Mínguó), is a state in East Asia. It is the nationalist government of China since its settlement in 1949. It is called the  '''[[Republic of China]] (ROC)''' (also called ''Taiwan'') which is a special region comprising the island of Taiwan and nearby islands ([[Pescadores]] islands and parts of [[Fujian]]). The Chinese Nationalist government ([[Kuomintang]] also called KMT) moved to Taiwan after the Communist army took over the capital of Beijing. Currently, the Chinese Nationalist government governs [[Taipei]], the capital of Taiwan. Taiwan is southeast of the [[People's Republic of China|China]] mainland, south of [[Japan]], and north of the [[Philippines]].

Formosa is the Portuguese name of Taiwan, which means "beautiful" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

The largest cities in Taiwan are the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of [[Taipei]] and the port city of [[Kaohsiung]].

Most people living in Taiwan (sometimes called Taiwanese) are [[Han]]. There are also [[Taiwanese Aborigines]] who have lived in Taiwan before the Han came to live there.

Taiwan has three large Han groups. They speak different [[dialect]]s of Chinese and their ancestors came from different places: the Southern Fujianese (from China's [[Fujian|Fujian Province]]), the [[Hakka people|Hakka]] (from China), and Mainlanders (from [[Mainland China]] after 1948).

== History ==
* 1517: A [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ship sees the island and names it "Ilha Formosa", or "Beautiful Island" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].
* 17th century: From 1624 until 1661 [[Dutch (people)|Dutch]] colonize the southern part of Formosa and established a colonial administration in [[Fort Zeelandia]], and the [[Spain|Spanish]] colonize the north and established a colonial administration in Fuerte Santo Domingo or [[Fort Santo Domingo]].  The Dutch eventually defeated the [[Spaniard]]s and took full control of Formosa. A Chinese general named [[Koxinga]], defeated the Dutch at the [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]].
* 1860: Taiwan becomes a [[treaty port]] following the [[Treaty of Tientsin]], opening the island to contact with the world.
* 1874: [[Japan]] invaded southern Taiwan, seemingly to "punish" the aborigines there for the murder of ship-wrecked Okinawan fishermen in 1871, but actually to establish a colony. Japanese forced withdraw later in the year after the [[Meiji]] and [[Qing]] empires nearly went to war.
* 1884-1885: Taiwan is blockaded by French navy during the [[Sino-Franco]] War.
* 1895: Qing China lost the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and gave Taiwan to [[Japan]] permanently.
* 1945: Japan lost in [[World War II]] to USA and gave up Taiwan permanently.
* 1946: USA accepts millions refugees and soldiers from China to Taiwan and USA President installs [[The Republic of China]] to govern Taiwan and to fight China and [[communism]].  
* 1947: Taiwanese widely protest [[government]]al [[corruption]] under the Nationalists. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] sends in the army to restore order, killing tens of thousands. Some Taiwanese began the [[Taiwan independence movement]].
* 1949:
** [[Chinese Civil War]] between the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party and the [[Communist Party of China]] (CCP).
** The Nationalists (KMT) lose the war, and escape to the island of Taiwan. They set up [[Taipei]] as the temporary capital of China (ROC).
** The Communist Party of China (CCP) establishes Beijing as the capital of The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC).  
* 1951: Japan signs the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] (1951) with USA.
* 1979: The KMT government jails many [[democracy]] activists who opposed it ([[Kaohsiung Incident]]).
* 1986: The [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) is formed; it is the first party to form in the ROC other than the KMT. It remains illegal for several years, but the KMT government does not try to ban it.
* 1987: The KMT government lifts the [[martial law]] after almost 40 years.
* 2000: [[Chen Shui-bian]] (DPP) becomes president.
* 2004: Chen Shui-bian is re-elected after a controversial assassination attempt, in which many KMT-supporters believed, was staged by Chen. However, after unwillingness to cooperate about his medical records the investigation was inconclusive.
* 2008: Former president Chen Sui-bian and his wife are arrested for corruption and money laundering.
* 2008: Ma Ying-jeou was elected as the president of the Republic of China and thus creating a change of political parties for the second time.
* 2009: Kaohsiung hosts the 2009 World Games.
* 2016: [[Tsai Ing-wen]] was elected as the first female president of Taiwan.

== Status of Taiwan ==
There are two [[China|Chinese]] governments in the world: The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the [[Republic of China]] (ROC). Today, in reality, the PRC government controls mainland China, and the ROC government governs Taiwan. The ROC government governed most of China mainland from 1911 to 1949, before losing control of China mainland to the PRC.

Today, people who live in Taiwan have different ideas. Although many Taiwanese think there is no freedom in China, there are still some Taiwanese who want to be united again with China. The majority of the people in Taiwan want to keep everything like it is now.

Today most countries of the world recognize the People's Republic of China as China. Even though Taiwan is not recognized by the UN as a sovereign nation,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2012/06/20-taiwan-un-winkler |title=Taiwan's UN Dilemma: To Be or Not To Be |author=Sigrid Winkler |date=June 2012 |website= |publisher=The Brookings Institution |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref> most countries still have close economic and cultural relations with Taiwan. So, both sides are not making any big changes from the political [[status quo]]. This policy was expressed in a 1992 [[Consensus]] among some leaders of both sides.

In [[March]] 2004, China's government passed a law called the Anti-[[Secession]] Law. The law requires the Chinese [[military]] to [[invade]] Taiwan immediately if they declare [[independence]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2004/12/chinas-new-anti-secession-law-escalates-tensions-in-the-taiwan-strait |title=China's New "Anti-Secession Law" Escalates Tensions in the TaiwanStrait |author=John J.

[[Category:Islands of Asia]]A '''trademark''' (or '''trade mark''') is a way for a business to help people to identify the [[product (consumer goods)|products]] that the business makes from products made by another business. A trademark can be a [[name]], word, [[phrase]], [[symbol]], [[logo]], [[design]], or [[picture]]. It can only be used on things made by the business that owns the trademark. 

For example, [[Coca-Cola]] and Coke are trademark names for a certain drink made by the Coca-Cola Company. No other business can use these names or any names similar to them. Other businesses can make a drink that is similar, like [[cola|colas]] soft drinks, but they have to use a different name for their drink, such as [[Pepsi]].

Another example is the [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] company which makes sporting goods like [[shoes]] and [[clothes]]. The "swoosh" symbol used on their products is a trademark.

Famous trademarks like Coca-Cola and Nike are used for [[brand]]ing whole families of products.

==Trademark and law==
===Getting a trademark===
Trademarks are protected by [[law]]. In some countries, a person or company can get a trademark simply by using the name, word, phrase, symbol, logo, design, or picture on its products.

Trademarks can also be registered. In that case, the business tells the [[government]] of its [[country]] that it wants to use a certain name, word, phrase, symbol, logo, design or picture as a trademark for the products it sells. If no other person or business is using the trademark to sell those products, then the government will list that trademark. Once it is listed, no one else can use that trademark for those products. This is called "[[:wikt:register|register]]ing" the trademark.

===Using another person's trademark===
If someone uses the trademark in a wrong way, the trademark owner can [[Lawsuit|sue]] the other person. If a [[court]] decides that the other person was not allowed to use the trademark, they might have to pay a [[fine]] to the trademark owner. 

If another person wants to use a trademark that they do not own, they can ask the trademark owner for [[permission]].  The trademark owner can grant the other person a [[license]].  The other person usually must pay some [[money]] to the trademark owner for the license.  This can be in the form of a [[percentage]] of the cost of the product that the other person sells called a royalty. For example, a person might pay Nike ten percent (10%) of the cost of each pair of [[shoe]]s it sells for the right to include the Swoosh.

===Marking products with trademarks===
When people write a word that is a trademark or show a picture or symbol that is a trademark, they should say that it is a trademark. If a trademark is not registered, they can write the word "Trademark", use the [[abbreviation]] "TM", or use the symbol '''™''' on their products. 

If a trademark is registered, they can use the letter R in a circle symbol: "®". People can also say it is a "registered trademark" or use the abbreviation "Reg."

==Service marks==
Trademarks are used for products.  Businesses that do things for people instead of making things are called [[service (economics)|service]] providers. They can get a [[service mark]] instead of a trademark. When people write or show a service mark, they can use the service mark symbol: "℠".

==Laws by country==
In the United States, the governing law for trademarks is the [[Lanham Act]], in Germany the [[Markengesetz]].

The '''Ten Commandments''', according to the book of [[Exodus]] in the [[Bible]], are rules for life given by [[God]] to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] to give to the [[Jew|People of Israel]].<ref>({{bibleverse||Exodus|19:23|HE}}), {{cite web |url=http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/G-dAtSinai.htm |title=Did God speak at Mt. Sinai |accessdate=2008-07-21 |format= |work=SimpleToRemember.com }}</ref> Although the Book of [[Deuteronomy]] talks about Mount Horeb,<ref>{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|5:2|HE}}</ref> it is often considered to have been a different name for the same place. The rules were written on stone tablets. These rules are important for [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]].

Sometimes these rules are also called '''Decalogue''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]], can be translated as ''ten statements''). The name decalogue first occurs in the [[Septuagint]]. The Jews received the commandments after they had left [[Egypt]] during the reign of [[Pharaoh]] [[Ramses]]. There are different [[text]]s talking about the commandments. Most of them are in the [[Bible]]: The Book of [[Exodus]], Chapter 20 and the book of [[Deuteronomy]], Chapter 5. The [[Qu'ran]] mentions the tablets but does not list the commandments.
Because the Bible has been translated many times, there are variations in the way the commandments are written.

==The Ten Commandments==

The Ten Commandments are<ref>{{cite web|title=The Commandments|url=http://www.askmoses.com/article.html?h=610&o=184}}</ref>
# Do not have any other god before God.
# Do not make yourself an idol.
# Do not take the Lord's name in vain.
# Remember to keep the Sabbath day holy.
# Honor your mother and father.
# Do not murder.
# Do not commit adultery.
# Do not steal.
# Do not testify false witness against your neighbor.
# Do not covet.

== In the Bible ==
The Bible in Basic English<ref>{{cite web |url=http://basicenglishbible.com/exodus/20.htm |title=Exodus 20: Bible in Basic English |accessdate=2008-07-21 |format= |work=BasicEnglishBible.com }}</ref> [[translation|translates]] the commandments from Exodus in this way:

* {{sup|1}} And God said all these words: {{sup|2}} I am the Lord took you out of the land of [[Egypt]], out of the [[prison]]-house. {{sup|3}} You are to have no other gods but me.
* {{sup|4}} You are not to make an image or picture of anything in [[heaven]] or on the [[earth]] or in the waters under the earth: {{sup|5}} You may not go down on your faces before them or give them [[worship]]: for I, the Lord your God, am a God who will not give his honour to another; and I will send punishment on the children for the wrongdoing of their fathers, to the third and fourth [[generation]] of my haters; {{sup|6}} And I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws.
* {{sup|7}} You are not to make use of the name of the Lord your God for an evil purpose; whoever takes the Lord's name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged a [[sin]]ner by the Lord
* {{sup|8}} Keep in memory the [[Sabbath]] and let it be a holy day. {{sup|9}} On six days do all your work: {{sup|10}} But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; on that day you are to do no work, you or your son or your daughter, your man-[[servant]] or your woman-servant, your [[cattle]] or the man from a strange country who is living among you: {{sup|11}} For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and everything in them, and he took his rest on the seventh day: for this reason the Lord has given his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy.
* {{sup|12}} Give honour to your father and to your mother, so that your life may be long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you.
* {{sup|13}} Do not [[death penalty|put anyone to death]] without cause.
* {{sup|14}} Do not be false to the [[marriage|married]] relation.
* {{sup|15}} Do not take the [[property]] of another.
* {{sup|16}} Do not give false [[wikt:witness|witness]] against your neighbour.
* {{sup|17}} Let not your desire be turned to your neighbour's house, or his wife or his man-servant or his woman-servant or his ox or his [[donkey|ass]] or anything which is his.

==Differences in teachings and interpretation==
These commandments are translated from ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] to [[Basic English]], so the exact words chosen may not mean to us exactly what they meant to the Hebrews. There are a variety of interpretations of these commandments:
;Images

[[File:Sun and Moon creation.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''The Creation of the Sun and the Moon'' is a [[fresco]] in the [[Sistine Chapel]]. It was done by [[Michelangelo]]. It shows an image of God.]]

One understanding on the commandment to not make "any image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above" is as from [[Roman Catholicism]]: they hold that "likenesses" may be built and used, as long as the object is not [[worship]]ped. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] has a very similar position. Eastern Orthodoxy teaches that the [[incarnation]] of an [[visible spectrum|invisible]] God as a visible human, Jesus, makes it alright to worship images (see [[Iconoclasm]]). But, for Jews, Muslims, and most other Christians that violates the commandment.

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] criticize the use of all of the above, as well as the use of the cross. The [[Amish]] forbid any sort of image, such as [[photography|photos]].

;Sabbath day
{{main|Sabbath|Shabbat}}

Jews honor the Sabbath ''(Shabbat)'' on Saturday, the seventh day of the week on the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]].

Most [[Christians]] honor the Sabbath on Sunday to remember the [[Resurrection]] of Jesus on the first day of the week on the Jewish calendar.

Some conservative Christians are "Sabbatarians" (most of these follow the [[Reformation|Reformed]] [[tradition]]s). Sabbatarians think the first day of the week or ''Lord's Day'' is the new Sabbath, because the 4th commandment has never been [[revoke]]d and Sabbath-keeping is in any case a creation [[ordinance]].

Others believe that the Sabbath remains as a day of rest on Saturday, while Sunday as a day of worship, in reference to Acts 20:7: the disciples came together on the first day of the week to break bread and to hear the preaching of the apostle Paul. Also, Jesus appeared to his followers on the "first day of the week" while they were in hiding.

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], and some others, believe that the custom of meeting for worship on Sunday originated in [[paganism]], specifically [[Sol Invictus]] and [[Mithraism]] (in which [[sun]] [[god]] worship took place on Sunday). Instead, Adventists keep Saturday as the Sabbath as a memorial to God's work of creation<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|2:1-3|9}}, {{bibleverse||Exodus|20:8-11|9}}, {{bibleverse||Exodus|16:23,29-30|9}}</ref> believing that none of the Ten Commandments can ever be destroyed.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|5:17-19|9}}, {{bibleverse||Exodus|31:16|9}}</ref> Seventh-day Sabbatarians claim that the seventh day Sabbath was kept by the majority of Christian groups until the [[2nd century|2nd]] and [[3rd century]], but because of opposition to Judaism after the [[Jewish-Roman wars]], the original custom was gradually replaced by Sunday as the day of worship.

;Married relations

To "be false to the married relation", called [[adultery]], is when a married person has [[sexual intercourse|sexual relations]] with a person other than his or her spouse. The Bible does not say whether or not this includes unmarried people having sex with each other, although some people think so.

;Killing or murder

There are different [[translation]]s of this commandment; the Hebrew words {{lang|he|לא תרצח}} are translated either as "thou shalt not kill" or "thou shalt not murder". Older Protestant translations of the Bible, those based on the [[Vulgate]] and Roman Catholic translations usually translate it "Thou shalt not [[kill]]". Jewish and newer Protestant versions tend to use "You shall not [[murder]]". There are different opinions as to which translation is more faithful to the original.

The many examples in the Old Testament of killing sanctioned by God, are quoted in defense of the view that "murder" is more accurate.  Furthermore, the Hebrew word for "kill" is "{{lang|he|הרג}}" - "''harog''", while the Hebrew word for "murder" is "{{lang|he|רצח}}" - "''retzach''", which is found in the Ten Commandments "{{lang|he|לא תרצח}}" - "''lo tirtzach''".

In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] talked about who was guilty of breaking these commandments. He said that even if someone was just angry and rude to another person, he might be judged for murder, and if he just looked with desire or [[lust]] at a woman, he had committed adultery in his heart.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|5:28|9}}</ref>

;Stealing

Many [[Theology|theologians]] (such as German Old Testament scholar A. Alt: ''Das Verbot des Diebstahls im Dekalog'' (1953)) suggest that commandment "you shall not steal" was originally intended against stealing people—abductions and [[slavery]]. This would be the same as the Jewish interpretation of the statement as "you shall not kidnap" (e.g. as stated by Rashi).

;False witness

To "give false witness" called [[lying]], may include all lying, or only lying in court, which is called [[perjury]].

=== Different numbering ===
The Bible does not number the commandments. Different religious groups have numbered them in different ways. The Jews, followed by Christian [[Protestant]]s, end the first commandment with "You are to have no other gods but me." as above. [[Catholic]]s and [[Lutheran]]s end the first commandment at "I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws." and separate in their last two commandments the desire for a man's wife from the desire for other things he owns.

The commandments passage in Exodus has more than ten important statements, there are 14 or 15 in all. While the Bible itself gives the count as "10", using the Hebrew phrase ''ʻaseret had'varim''—translated as ''the 10 words'', ''statements'' or ''things'', this phrase does not appear in the passages usually presented as being "the Ten Commandments".<ref>{{bibleverse|Exodus||34:28|HE}}, {{bibleverse|Deuteronomy||4:13|HE}}, {{bibleverse|Deuteronomy||10:4|HE}}</ref> Various religions divide the commandments differently.

== Muslim understanding ==
[[Islam]] teaches that the Bible is a [[revelation]] from God, but that the text used in Judaism and Christianity has been [[wikt:corrupt|corrupted]]. The Ten Commandments are not explicitly mentioned in the [[Qur'an]], but each is implied by the following verses in the Quran.

# "There is no other god beside God."({{cite quran|47|19|style=ref}})
# "My Lord, make this a peaceful land, and protect me and my children from worshiping [[idol]]s." ({{cite quran|14|35|style=ref}})
# "Do not subject God's name to your casual swearing, that you may appear [[righteousness|righteous]], [[piety|pious]], or to get [[wikt:credibility|credibility]] among the people." ({{cite quran|2|224|style=ref}})
# "O you who believe, when the Congregational Prayer (Salat Al-Jumu`ah) is announced on Friday, you shall hasten to the commemoration of GOD, and drop all business." ({{cite quran|62|9|style=ref}})<ref>The Sabbath was abandoned with the revelation of the Quran. Muslims are told in the Quran that the Sabbath was only decreed for the Jews. ({{cite quran|16|124|style=ref}}) God, however, ordered Muslims to make every effort and drop all businesses to attend the congregational (Friday) prayer. The Submitters may tend to their business during the rest of the day.</ref>
# "....and your parents shall be honored. As long as one or both of them live, you shall never say to them, "Uff" (the slightest gesture of annoyance), nor shall you shout at them; you shall treat them [[wikt:amicable|amicably]]." ({{cite quran|17|23|style=ref}})
# "....anyone who murders any person who had not committed murder or horrendous crimes, it shall be as if he murdered all the people." (5:32)
# "You shall not commit [[adultery]]; it is a gross sin, and an evil behavior." ({{cite quran|17|32|style=ref}})
# "The [[theft|thief]], male or female, you shall mark their hands as a punishment for their crime, and to serve as an example from God.  God is Almighty, Most Wise." ({{cite quran|5|38|39|style=ref}})
# "Do not withhold any [[wikt:testimony|testimony]] by [[wikt:conceal|concealing]] what you had witnessed. Anyone who withholds a testimony is sinful at heart." ({{cite quran|2|283|style=ref}})
# "And do not want what we bestowed upon any other people. Such are temporary ornaments of this life, whereby we put them to the test. What your Lord provides for you is far better, and everlasting." ({{cite quran|20|131|style=ref}})

== Other religions ==
In general, religions other than those mentioned (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) do not recognise the Ten Commandments as [[Ethics|ethical standards]]. Many of them ([[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], etc.) have similar laws or principles though.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unification.org/ucbooks/WorldScr/WS-02-03.htm|title=World Scripture: The Decalogue by Andrew Wilson|accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref>
In the [[atheist]] [[Soviet Union]] the [[Moral Code of the Builder of Communism]] was a set of rules that resembled the Ten Commandments.

==The Ritual Decalogue==

The term "Ten Commandments" generally applies to the list mentioned in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5. However, there is a continuous story being told starting in Exodus 31:18 (where the stones are created), Exodus 32:19 (where the tablets are broken) and Exodus 34. This story lists a very different set of commandments. This version is sometimes called "Ritual Decalogue". [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and the people after him who followed the [[documentary hypothesis]], note that Exodus 34:28 seems to refer to these Ten Commandments rather than the traditional ones. These people thought that the commandments in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 show a later set of Ten Commandments, and that the ten listed in Exodus 34 were the original Ten Commandments, now known as the ''Ritual Decalogue'' (as opposed to the better-known "Ethical Decalogue"). The differences between the two Decalogues highlight the development of sacred texts over a long time and from differing narrative traditions by incorporating two differing sets of Ten Commandments.

== Influence ==
The commandments have influenced Jewish [[ethics]] and [[law]] and, through [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], Western [[ethics]] and [[law]] since the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>*{{Cite book|last= Coogan |first= Michael |year= 2014 |title= The Ten Commandments; A Short History of an Ancient Text |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |isbn=9780300178715}}</ref>  Moses is the founder of basis of the philosophy of law as well as such modern legal doctrines as independent judiciary and separation of powers.<ref>Barenboim Peter, [http://www.florentine-society.ru/pdf/Biblical_Roots_of_Separation_of_Powers.pdf ''Biblical Roots of Separation of Powers'', Moscow, Letny Sad, 2005].

==In the Arts==
===Film===
There have been two famous films of this name; both were directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]], a silent movie in 1923, and a movie in 1956, starring [[Charlton Heston]] as Moses. That one was the biggest money-making movie that year.

{{disambig}}[[File:Arbres.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Trees around a lake.]]
[[File:Aspen-PopulusTremuloides-2001-09-27.jpg|thumb|200px|The Trembling [[Aspen]] in its autumn colours]]
[[File:Ficus sp. in Guanacaste.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Strangler fig]] tree in [[Costa Rica]]. Locally known as ''Guanacaste''.]]

A '''tree''' is a tall [[plant]] with a trunk and branches made of [[wood]]. Trees can live for many years. The oldest tree ever discovered is approximately 5,000 years old. The four main parts of a tree are the [[root]]s, the [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]], the [[branch]]es, and the [[leaf|leaves]]. 

The roots of a tree are usually under the ground. One case for which this is not true are the roots of the [[mangrove]] tree which are often under water.<ref name="nat">{{cite  web|url=http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/plants/mangrove_trees.htm|title=Mangrove Trees|publisher=Naturia.per.sg}}</ref> A single tree has many roots. The roots carry food and [[water]] from the ground through the trunk and branches to the leaves of the tree. They can also breathe in air.<ref name="nat" /> Sometimes, roots are specialized into [[aerial root]]s, which can also provide support, as is the case with the [[Banyan]] tree. 

The trunk is the main body of the tree. The trunk is covered with [[bark]] which protects it from damage. Branches grow from the trunk. They spread out so that the leaves can get more sunlight.

The leaves of a tree are green most of the time, but they can come in many colours, shapes and sizes. The leaves take in sunlight and use water and food from the roots to make the tree grow, and to reproduce.

Trees and [[shrub]]s take in [[water]] and [[carbon dioxide]] and give out [[oxygen]] with sunlight to form [[sugar]]s. This is the opposite of what animals do in respiration. Plants also do some respiration using oxygen the way animals do. They need oxygen as well as carbon dioxide to live.

== Parts of trees ==
[[File:Leavessnipedale.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Beech]] leaves.]]
[[File:WisconsinScenery.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Tree [[root]]s anchor the structure and provide [[water]] and [[nutrients]]. The ground has [[erosion|eroded]] away around the roots of this young [[pine]] tree.]]
[[File:Tree.ring.arp.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Growth rings|The dark lines between the centre and the bark are [[medullary ray]]s, which allow nutrients to flow across the tree trunk. ]]

The parts of a tree are the [[root]]s, [[trunk (botany)|trunk]](s), [[branch]]es, [[twig]]s and [[leaf|leaves]]. Tree stems are mainly made of support and transport tissues ([[xylem]] and [[phloem]]). [[Wood]] consists of ''xylem'' cells, and [[bark]] is made of ''phloem'' and other tissues external to the vascular cambium. 

=== Growth of the trunk ===
As a tree grows, it may produce [[growth ring]]s as new wood is laid down around the old wood. In areas with seasonal climate, wood produced at different times of the year may alternate light and dark rings. In temperate climates, and tropical climates with a single wet-dry season alternation, the growth rings are annual, each pair of light and dark rings being one year of growth. In areas with two wet and dry seasons each year, there may be two pairs of light and dark rings each year; and in some (mainly semi-desert regions with irregular rainfall), there may be a new growth ring with each [[rainfall]].<ref name=mirov>Mirov, N.T. 1967. ''The genus Pinus''. Ronald Press.</ref> 

In tropical [[rainforest]] regions, with constant year-round climate, growth is continuous. Growth rings are not visible and there is no change in the wood texture. In [[species]] with annual rings, these rings can be counted to find the age of the tree. This way, wood taken from trees in the past can be dated, because the patterns of ring thickness are very distinctive. This is [[dendrochronology]]. Very few tropical trees can be accurately dated in this manner.

=== Roots ===
The [[root]]s of a tree are generally down in earth, providing [[wiky:anchorage|anchorage]] for the parts above ground, and taking in [[water]] and [[nutrients]] from the [[soil]]. Most trees need help from a fungus for better uptake of nutriens: this is [[mycorrhiza]]. Most of a tree's [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] comes from carbon dioxide absorbed from the atmosphere (see [[photosynthesis]]). Above ground, the trunk gives height to the leaf-bearing branches, competing with other plant species for [[sunlight]]. In many trees, the order of the branches makes exposure of the leaves to sunlight better.

=== Exceptions ===
Not all trees have all the organs or parts as mentioned above. For example, most palm trees are not branched, the [[Saguaro|saguaro cactus]] of North America has no functional leaves, [[tree fern]]s do not produce bark, etc. Based on their general shape and size, all of these are nonetheless generally regarded as trees. Trees can vary very much. A plant form that is similar to a tree, but generally having smaller, multiple trunks and/or branches that arise near the ground, is called a [[shrub]] (or a bush). Even though that is true, no precise differentiation between shrubs and trees is possible. Given their small size, [[bonsai]] plants would not technically be 'trees', but one should not confuse reference to the form of a species with the size or shape of individual specimens. A spruce seedling does not fit the definition of a tree, but all spruces are trees.

== Classification ==
[[File:TicinoTree.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[Sweet Chestnut]] tree in [[Ticino]], [[Switzerland]]]]
A tree is a plant form that can be found in many different [[order (biology)|orders]] and [[family (biology)|families]] of plants. Trees show many [[growth form]]s, leaf type and shape, bark traits and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]].

The tree form has changed separately in classes of plants that are not related, in response to similar problems (for the tree). With about 100,000 [[species|types]] of trees, the number of tree types in the whole world might be one [[wikt:fourth|fourth]] of all living [[plant]] types.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkbx.com/2008/05/02/scientists-to-capture-tree-dna-worldwide/#more-835 |title=TreeBOL project |accessdate=2008-07-11}}</ref> Most tree species grow in [[tropical]] parts of the world and many of these areas have not been surveyed yet by [[botanist]]s (they study plants), making species difference and ranges not well understood.<ref>Friis, Ib, and Henrik Balslev. 2005. ''Plant diversity and complexity patterns: local, regional, and global dimensions : proceedings of an international symposium held at the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters in Copenhagen, Denmark, 25–28 May 2003.'' Biologiske skrifter, 55. Copenhagen: Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters. pp 57-59.</ref>

The earliest trees were [[tree fern]]s, [[horsetail]]s and [[Clubmoss|lycophytes]], which grew in [[forest]]s in the [[Carboniferous]] period; tree ferns still survive, but the only surviving horsetails and lycophytes are not of tree form. Later, in the [[Triassic]] Period, [[Pinophyta|conifers]], [[ginkgo]]s, [[cycad]]s and other [[gymnosperm]]s appeared, and subsequently [[flowering plant]]s in the [[Cretaceous]] period. Most species of trees today are flowering plants ([[Angiosperms]]) and [[conifers]].

A small group of trees growing together is called a [[grove (nature)|grove]] or '''copse''', and a landscape covered by a dense growth of trees is called a '''[[forest]]'''. Several [[biotope]]s are defined largely by the trees that inhabit them; examples are [[rainforest]] and [[taiga]] (see [[ecozone]]s). A landscape of trees scattered or spaced across grassland (usually grazed or burned over periodically) is called a '''[[savanna]]'''. A forest of great age is called '''[[old growth forest]]''' or '''[[ancient woodland]]''' (in the UK). A very young tree is called a sapling.

== Records ==
=== Height ===
The Coast [[Redwood]]: '''115.56&nbsp;m''' '''(379.1&nbsp;ft)''', in Redwood National Park, [[California]] is believed to be the world's tallest tree.<ref name=Sequoia_sempervirens>{{cite web |url=http://www.conifers.org/cu/se/index.htm |title=Gymnosperm Database: ''Sequoia sempervirens'' |accessdate=2007-06-10 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=Hyperion, Redwood National Park, CA, 115.55 m}}</ref> 

The tallest trees in [[Australia]] are all [[Eucalyptus|eucalypts]], of which there are more than 700 species. The so-called 'Mountain ash'. with a slim, straight trunk, grows to over 300 feet.

=== Stoutest trees ===
The stoutest living single-trunk species in diameter is the African [[Baobab]]: '''{{convert|15.9|m|ft|abbr=on}}''', Glencoe Baobab (measured near the ground), Limpopo Province, [[South Africa]].<ref name=southafrica>{{cite web|url=http://www2.dwaf.gov.za/dwaf/download.asp?f=4148___list+of+proposed+Champion+trees.pdf&docId=4148 |title=List of Champion Trees published for comment, 2005, South African Department of Water Affairs and Forestry |accessdate=2010-01-18}}</ref> This tree split up in November 2009 and now the stoutest baobab could be Sunland Baobab (South Africa) with diameter 10.64 m and circumference of 33.4 m.

Some trees develop multiple trunks (whether from an individual tree or multiple trees) which grow together. The [[Sacred Fig]] is a notable example of this, forming additional 'trunks' by growing adventitious roots down from the branches, which then thicken up when the root reaches the ground to form new trunks; a single Sacred Fig tree can have hundreds of such trunks.

=== Age of trees ===
The life-span of trees is determined by growth rings. These can be seen if the tree is cut down or in cores taken from the edge to the center of the tree. Correct determination is only possible for trees which make growth rings, generally those which occur in seasonal climates. Trees in uniform non-seasonal tropical climates are always growing and do not have distinct growth rings. It is also only possible for trees which are solid to the center of the tree; many very old trees become hollow as the dead [[Wood#Heartwood and sapwood|heartwood]] decays away. For some of these species, age estimates have been made on the basis of extrapolating current growth rates, but the results are usually little better than guesses or speculation. White proposed a method of estimating the age of large and veteran trees in the [[United Kingdom]] by correlation between a tree's stem diameter, growth character and age.<ref>White J. 1990. ''Estimating the age of large and veteran trees in Britain''. [[Forestry Commission]] Edinburgh.</ref> 

The verified oldest measured ages are:
# Great Basin Bristlecone Pine (Methuselah) ''Pinus longaeva'': 4,844 years<ref name="Gymnosperm_oldest">[http://www.conifers.org/topics/oldest.htm Gymnosperm Database: How old is that tree?].  Retrieved on 2008-04-17.</ref>
# Alerce: 3,622 years<ref name="Gymnosperm_oldest"/>

# Huon-pine: 2,500 years<ref name="Gymnosperm_oldest"/>

Other species suspected of reaching exceptional age include European Yew ''Taxus baccata'' (probably over 2,000 years<ref>Harte J. 1996. How old is that old yew? ''At the Edge'' 4: 1-9. Available [http://www.indigogroup.co.uk/edge/oldyews.htm online]</ref><ref>Kinmonth F. 2006. Ageing the yew - no core, no curve? ''International Dendrology Society Yearbook'' 2005: 41-46 ISSN 0307-332X</ref>) and Western Redcedar ''Thuja plicata''. The oldest known European Yew is the Llangernyw Yew in the Churchyard of Llangernyw village in North [[Wales]] which is estimated to be between 4,000 and 5,000 years old.

The oldest reported age for an angiosperm tree is 2293 years for the [[Sri Maha Bodhi]] [[Sacred Fig]] (''Ficus religiosa'') planted in 288 BC at Anuradhapura, [[Sri Lanka]]; this is said to be the oldest human-planted tree with a known planting date.

== Tree value estimation ==
Studies have shown that trees contribute as much as 27% of the appraised land value in certain markets.<ref>"Protecting Existing Trees on Building Sites" p.4 published by the City of [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], March 1989, Reprinted February 2000</ref>

These most likely use diameter measured at breast height (dbh), 4.5&nbsp;feet (140&nbsp;cm) above ground—not the larger base diameter. A general model for any year and diameter is: 

:<math>\\text{Value} = 17.27939 \\times (\\text{diameter})^2 \\times 1.022^{\\text{year} - 1985}</math>

== Tree climbing ==
'''Tree climbing''' is an activity where one moves around in the crown of trees.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.treeclimbing.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=17&Itemid=140|title=Benefits of Tree Climbing}}</ref>

[[File:Tree climbing.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A tree climber]]

Use of a [[rope]], [[helmet]], and [[safety harness|harness]] are the minimum requirements to ensure the safety of the climber. Other equipment can also be used depending on the experience and skill of the tree climber. Some tree climbers take special [[hammock]]s called "Treeboats" and Portaledges with them into the tree canopies where they can enjoy a [[wikt:picnic|picnic]] or nap, or spend the night.

Tree climbing is an "on rope" activity that puts together many different tricks and gear originally derived from [[rock climbing]] and [[caving]]. These techniques are used to climb trees for many purposes, including tree care ([[arboriculture|arborists]]), animal rescue, recreation, sport, research, and activism.

== Damage ==
[[File:Tasmania logging 08 Mighty tree.jpg|thumb|200px|''El Grande'', about 280 feet high, the most [[wikt:massive|massive]] (though not the tallest) ''[[Eucalyptus regnans]]'' was accidentally killed by loggers burning-off the remains of legally loggable trees (less than 280 ft) that had been felled all around it]]

The three big sources of tree damage are [[biotic]] (from living sources),  [[abiotic]] (from non-living sources) and [[deforestation]] (cutting trees down). Biotic sources would include insects which might bore into the tree, deer which might rub bark off the trunk, or [[fungi]], which might attach themselves to the tree.<ref>Wiseman, P. Eric 2008. ''Integrated pest management tactics''. Continuing Education Unit, International Arboricultural Society Vol 17.</ref>

Abiotic sources include [[lightning]], [[vehicles]] impacts, and construction activities. Construction activities can involve a number of damage sources, including grade changes that prevent aeration to roots, spills involving toxic chemicals such as cement or petroleum products, or severing of branches or roots. People can damage trees also.

Both damage sources can result in trees becoming dangerous, and the term "hazard trees" is commonly used by arborists, and industry groups such as power line operators. Hazard trees are trees which due to disease or other factors are more susceptible to falling during windstorms, or having parts of the tree fall. 

The process of finding the danger a tree presents is based on a process called the quantified tree risk assessment.<ref>Ellison M.J. 2005  Quantified tree risk assessment used in the management of amenity trees. ''Arboric''. International Society of Arboriculture. '''31''':2 57-65</ref>

Trees are similar to people. Both can take a lot of some types of damage and survive, but even small amounts of certain types of trauma can result in death. Arborists are very aware that established trees will not tolerate any appreciable disturbance of the root system.<ref>Schoeneweiss D.F. Prevention and treatment of construction damage. ''Journal of Arborculture'' '''8''':169</ref> Even though that is true, most people and construction professionals do not realize how easily a tree can be killed.

One reason for confusion about tree damage from construction involves the dormancy of trees during winter. Another factor is that trees may not show symptoms of damage until 24 months or longer after damage has occurred. For that reason, persons who do not know about caring for trees may not link the actual cause with the later damaged effect.

Various organizations have long recognized the importance of construction activities that impact tree health. The impacts are important because they can result in monetary losses due to tree damage and resultant remediation or replacement costs, as well as violation of government ordinances or community or subdivision restrictions. 

As a result, protocols (standard ways) for tree management prior to, during and after construction activities are well established, tested and refined (changed). These basic steps are involved:
* Review of the construction plans
* Development of the related tree inventory
* Application of standard construction tree management protocols
* Assessment of potential for expected tree damages
* Development of a tree protection plan (providing for pre-, concurrent, and post construction damage prevention and remediation steps)
* Development of a tree protection plan
* Development of a remediation plan
* Implementation of [[tree protection zone]]s (TPZs)
* Assessment of construction tree damage, post-construction
* Implementation of the remediation plan

== Trees in culture ==

The tree has always been a cultural symbol. Common icons are the World tree, for instance Yggdrasil,<ref name="Mountfort 2003 41">{{cite book |title=Nordic runes: understanding, casting, and interpreting the ancient Viking oracle |last=Mountfort |first=Paul Rhys |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=Inner Traditions / Bear & Company |location= |isbn=9780892810932 |page=41 |pages=279 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_3B7EmvAqngC |accessdate=}}</ref> and the tree of life. The tree is often used to represent nature or the environment itself. A common mistake (wrong thing) is that trees get most of their mass from the ground.<ref name=TedTalk>[http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/jonathan_drori_on_what_we_think_we_know.html Jonathan Drori on what we think we know | Video on TED.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In fact, 99% of a tree's mass comes from the air.<ref name=TedTalk/>

=== Wishing trees ===

A Wish Tree (or wishing tree) is a single tree, usually distinguished by species, position or appearance, which is used as an object of wishes and offerings. Such trees are identified as possessing a special religious or spiritual value. By tradition, believers make votive offerings in order to gain from that nature spirit, saint or goddess fulfillment of a wish.

=== Tree worship ===
Tree worship refers to the tendency of many [[society|societies]] in all of history to worship or otherwise mythologize [[trees]]. Trees have played a very important role in many of the world's [[mythology|mythologies]] and [[religion]]s, and have been given deep and sacred meanings throughout the ages. Human beings, seeing the growth and death of trees, the  [[elasticity]] of their branches, the sensitiveness and the annual (every year) decay and revival of their foliage, see them as powerful symbols of growth, decay and [[resurrection]]. The most ancient cross-cultural symbolic representation of the [[universe]]'s construction is the 'world tree'. 

==== World tree ====
[[File:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Yggdrasil]], the World Ash (Norse)]]

The tree, with its branches reaching up into the sky, and roots deep into the earth, can be seen to [[wikt:dwell|dwell]] in three worlds - a link between heaven, the earth, and the underworld, uniting above and below. It is also both a feminine symbol, bearing sustenance; and a masculine, [[phallic]] symbol - another union.

For this reason, many mythologies around the world have the concept of the World tree, a great tree that acts as an ''Axis mundi'', holding up the cosmos, and providing a link between the heavens, earth and underworld. In European mythology the best known example is the tree [[Yggdrasil]] from [[Norse mythology]].<ref name="Mountfort 2003 41"/>

The world tree is also an important part of [[Mesoamerica]]n mythologies, where it represents the four [[cardinal direction]]s ([[north]], [[south]], [[east]], and [[west]]). The concept of the world tree is also closely linked to the motif of the Tree of life.

=== In literature ===

In literature, a mythology was notably developed by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], his Two Trees of Valinor playing a central role in his  1964 ''[[Tree and Leaf]]''. [[William Butler Yeats]] describes a "holy tree" in his poem ''The Two Trees'' (1893).

== List of trees ==

* [[Coconut|Coconut Tree]]
* [[Cottonwood Tree]]
* [[Eucalyptus|Gum tree]]
* [[Fir]]

In [[theatre]], a '''tragedy''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] that ends badly for the hero or heroine or others. A tragedy is usually about a person who has many good qualities, but has one poor quality (called a "tragic flaw") that causes trouble for him, and may cause him, or his family or friends, to be in trouble.

Often in a tragedy, there is one thing that the hero does not want to happen and tries to prevent, but no matter what he does, it makes this thing more and more sure to happen. Tragedies originated in [[Ancient Greek theatre]], where they were performed at religious festivals. The three most famous Greek tragedy writers were [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]. Other famous writers include [[Shakespeare]] and [[Jean Racine]].

Sometimes the word '''tragedy''' is also used to mean something with a bad outcome in real life.

[[Category:Theatrical forms]][[Image:Scientific classification.svg|right|100px|The hierarchy of scientific classification]]

'''Taxonomy''' is a branch of [[science]]. It is about the [[law]]s and [[principle]]s of classifying things.<ref>''Oxford English dictionary''</ref> From one type of taxonomy, many classifications might be produced.

The best-known kind of taxonomy is used for the [[Biological classification|classification]] of lifeforms (living and extinct). Each organism has a scientific name. This name is part of the '''[[biological classification]]''' of that [[species]]. The name is the same all over the world, so that when scientists from different places talk or write about the living thing, they can understand each other. In addition, a species has a position in the [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]. Thus the [[crow]] is ''Corvus corone'', a member of the [[Corvidae]] [[Family (biology)|family]], and they are [[passerine]] [[bird]]s. That is well agreed, but the classification of other groups is not agreed at present, and often several classifications are being discussed.

Living things are classified into three [[Domain (biology)|domains]]: [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[eukaryotes]]. The highest rank in a domain is the [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]]. Each kingdom has many smaller groups in it, called [[Phylum|phyla]].<ref>See [[List of animal phyla]]</ref> Each phylum has more smaller groups in it, called [[Class (biology)|classes]]. This pattern looks like branches on a tree with smaller branches growing from them. Each species is put into a group because of what it does, how and what it eats, special body parts, and so on. At the end of the pattern, the groups ([[Genus|genera]]) are very small. Then each species in the genus is given its own name. 

When someone writes about a living thing and its formal scientific name, they write the genus and species name. This is known as [[binomial nomenclature]], because it uses two names for each [[organism]]. The first is the [[genus]] name, and the second is the [[species]] in that genus. The scientific name of the [[domestic cat]] is ''Felis catus''. Sometimes it is enough to write ''F. catus''. 

These are the major groups ([[taxon|rank]]s) used in taxonomy:

[[Kingdom (biology)|Kingdom]] --> [[Phylum]] --> [[Class (biology)|Class]] --> [[Order (biology)|Order]] --> [[Family (biology)|Family]] --> [[Genus]] --> [[Species]]

Some [[mnemonic]]s (sayings to help a person remember something):
* King Phillip Came Over From Greater Spain,

When people started naming species, [[Latin language|Latin]] was a language widely used in [[Europe]]. All species names are still written in Latin. This has some advantages. Since Latin is no longer spoken, it is unchanging, and is owned by no-one. It gets over the problem of every language having its own names for animals and plants.

Scientists used to write the official description of each new species in Latin. On 1 January 2012, the [[International Botanical Congress]] changed to allow English (as well as Latin) for describing new plant species.<ref>{{cite web|title=Veni, vidi, vici – and now history|first=Adrian|last=Higgins|work=Washington Post|date=19 January 2012|page=A1|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-30538042.html}}</ref> The [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] recommends choosing a language that is widely used, and that is used in the places where the species lives.

== Cladism ==
An important modern approach to taxonomy is [[Clade|cladism]]. This approach is based on the branching (tree-like) course of [[evolution]]. Like traditional [[Linnaeus|Linnaean]] classification, it uses [[traits]] to decide on the branches of the classification. It insists on groups being [[monophyletic]]. This has the effect that [[birds]] are not a class but a sub-group of [[dinosaurs]]. It also means the ranking system described above would be abolished. 

So cladism has different principles of taxonomy, and produces a different kind of taxonomy. Decisions, where possible, are supported by [[DNA]] [[sequence analysis]]. Present-day [[biological classification]] is a mixture of the old Linnaean and the modern cladistic principles of taxonomy. In parts, it is changing rapidly. The classifications presented in Wikipedia at present are often a compromise between the two systems. The details are regularly discussed.

=== Turmoil in taxonomy ===
Today, there are many changes in the classification of living things. This turmoil in taxonomy has led to many alternative [[Biological classification|classifications]]. It is caused partly from the move from [[Linnaeus|Linnaean]] to [[Cladistics|cladistic]] principles,<ref name=Ridley>Ridley, Mark 1986. ''Evolution and classification''. Longman, London. ISBN 0-582-44497-7</ref> and partly by the use of [[DNA sequence]] data in taxonomy. An example is: the way [[derived]] groups like birds should not be classified at the same level as the group they evolved from. Yet birds have traditionally been a [[Class (biology)|class]] under the Linnaean system. 

The turmoil sometimes results in differences between related pages. Pages may rely on different references and different authors' opinions as to the present best arrangement.

The following source is good on the differences between cladistic and taxonomic classification systems:
*Grant, Verne 2003.  Incongruence between cladistic and taxonomic systems. ''American Journal of Botany''. '''90''' (9) 1263-1270. [http://www.amjbot.org/content/90/9/1263.full]

<!-- interwiki -->[[Image:Theft-p1000763.jpg|thumb|Example of theft: only the wheel of the bicycle is left]]
'''Theft''' is when one person or group takes from another [[person]][[business|s]] or [[state]] any [wikt:object object], [[money]], or [[information]] without permission. A person who has been convicted of theft may be called a '''thief'''. However, the practice of engaging in theft is also called '''stealing'''. There are many different types of theft, such as [[pickpocketing]] and [[shoplifting]]. [[Burglary]] and [[robbery]] are separate crimes which involve theft.

{{cn|date=January 2015}}

Stealing is basic and is illegal almost everywhere. Thieves steal things sometimes because they want to have something for themselves, or because they want to sell something for [[money]]. Sometimes thieves will come up with plans to rob a store, bank, house, or person, and sometimes they will just see a chance to steal something and take it. Some thieves have an [[impulse control disorder]]. 

When thieves steal things for money, they usually pick [[car]]s, [[electronic]]s, [[laptop]]s, or other things they can sell easily. Sometimes thieves use [[pawn shop]]s to sell things easily to someone who will not ask questions.

Around 65 million people live in the UK.<ref name="2011 Census"/> Most people in the UK speak [[English language|English]]. There are five native languages other than English. They are [[Welsh language|Welsh]] in Wales, [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] in Scotland and Northern Ireland, [[Irish language|Irish]] in Northern Ireland, and [[cornish language|Cornish]] in Cornwall.

Between the 17th and mid 20th-centuries Britain was a world power. It became a [[British Empire|colonial empire]] that controlled large areas of [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[North America]] and [[Oceania]].<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/</ref> Many countries left and became independent from the empire in the 20th century, although Britain keeps [[Commonwealth of Nations|links with most countries of its former empire]].

Some cities in the UK are [[London]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Cardiff]], [[Belfast]], [[Manchester]], [[Bristol]], [[Liverpool]], [[Birmingham]], [[York]] and [[Glasgow]].

==Prehistory==

[[File:Stonehenge Wide Angle.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stonehenge]] in the United Kingdom]]

[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] remains show that the first group of people to live in the British Isles were hunter-gatherers after the last [[ice age]] ended. The date is not known: perhaps as early as 8000<small>BC</small> but certainly by 5000<small>BC</small>. They built [[mesolithic]] wood and stone [[monument]]s. [[Stonehenge]] was built between 3000 and 1600<small>BC</small>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/stonehenge/world-heritage-sites/|title=Stonehenge and Avebury: A World Heritage Site|author=English Heritage|accessdate=2011-06-21}}</ref> [[Celt]]ic tribes arrived from mainland Europe. Britain was a changing collection of tribal areas, with no overall leader. Julius Caesar tried to invade (take over) the island in 55<small>BC</small> but was not able to do so. The Romans successfully invaded in 43<small>AD</small>.<ref>Branigan, Keith, 1980, ''Roman Britain: Life in an Imperial Province'', Readers Digest, pp12-16</ref>

==History==
{{see also|History of the United Kingdom}}
History begins when there is a written record. Writing was brought to Britain by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. Rome ruled in Britain from 44AD to 410AD, but they only ruled England and Wales. The Romans never ruled Scotland north of the Clyde-Forth valley, or Ireland; their northern boundary varied from time to time, and was marked for a while at [[Hadrian's Wall]].

After the Romans, two waves of [[immigration|immigrants]] came to Britain. The first were [[Germanic peoples|German]] tribes: the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]]. [[English language|English]], the language, is a development from [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Old English]], and is a Germanic language.  The second were the [[Viking]]s.

===Britain unified===
After a long period when [[England]] was split into various kingdoms, it was made into one country by Æthelstan ([[Athelstan]]) in 945<small>AD</small>. England and Wales were unified by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (Longshanks) by force in the 13th century.

Union with Scotland took much longer; there were hundreds of years of conflicts between both parts of Britain. This union between England and Scotland in 1707 formed the United Kingdom of Great Britain, which merged Scotland and England into one country.

In 1603, when [[Queen]] [[Elizabeth I of England]] died, her closest relative was [[King]] [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]]. He became king of England as well as king of Scotland. In 1707, the Scottish and English Parliaments agreed the Treaty of Union, which joined the two countries into one country called ''The Kingdom of Great Britain'' under Queen [[Anne of Great Britain|Anne]].
[[File:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|left|120px|thumb|[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] has reigned since 1952.]]

By 1800, both Scotland and England had already independently had much influence over [[Ireland]] since 1200. In that year laws were passed in Great Britain and Ireland to merge the two states. The new country was called the ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland''. In 1922 much of Ireland became independent as the [[Irish Free State]] (now called [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) from the United Kingdom. However, six northern counties (called [[Northern Ireland]]) continue to be part of the United Kingdom. The country was renamed ''The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland''.

===Parliament===
The British people are ruled by [[Parliament]], not by monarchs. Parliament started in 1215 as an advisory body for the monarch, but by the 17th century it had gained enough power to successfully defeat [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], in the [[English Civil War]]. [[Oliver Cromwell]] became Lord Protector. Though the monarchy was restored after his death, the Crown slowly became the secondary power, and Parliament the first. Members of Parliament (called MPs) were elected, but until the early twentieth century, only men who owned property could vote. In the nineteenth century, more people were given [[suffrage]] (the right to vote), but even so, by 1900, women could not vote, and only 40% of men were rich enough to vote. But in 1928, all adults, male and female, got the vote: this is called universal suffrage.

Parliament is in London, but it has power over the whole of the UK. Today, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland each have their own parliaments as well, but they have more limited powers. There are also parliaments in the [[Isle of Man]] and the [[Channel Islands]], which are islands that are partly controlled by the UK, and partly independent.

The members of Parliament belong to [[political party|political parties]]: the biggest parties are the Labour Party, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats. Members of the same party agree to act and vote more or less together. A party with more than half the seats (a majority) forms the government; the leader of the party becomes the [[Prime Minister]], who then appoints other ministers. Because the government has a majority in Parliament, it can normally control what laws are passed.

*[[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]]
*[[Scottish Gaelic]]

===Germanic languages===

==Geography==
[[File:United Kingdom labelled map7 vector.svg|thumb|175px|The [[countries of the United Kingdom]]]]
[[File:uk topo en.jpg|thumb|175px|left|The topography of the UK]]
The UK is made up of four different countries: [[Wales]], [[England]] and [[Scotland]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. The capital city of Wales is [[Cardiff]]. The capital city of England is [[London]]. The capital city of Scotland is [[Edinburgh]] and the capital city of Northern Ireland is [[Belfast]]. Other large cities in the UK are [[Birmingham]], [[Bristol]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool, Mersyside|Liverpool]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Leeds]], [[Sheffield]], [[Glasgow]], [[Southampton]], [[Leicester]], [[Coventry]], [[City of Bradford|Bradford]] and [[Nottingham]].

The UK is north-west off the coast of mainland [[Europe]]. Around the UK are the [[North Sea]], the [[English Channel]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The UK also rules, usually indirectly, a number of smaller places (mostly islands) round the world, which are known as ''overseas territories''. They are remnants of the  [[British Empire]].

The [[weather]] of the United Kingdom is changeable and unpredictable. Summers are moderately warm, winters are cool to cold. Rain falls throughout the year, and more on the west than the east because of its northerly latitude and the warm water from the [[Atlantic Ocean]]'s [[Gulf Stream]]. The usually moderate prevailing winds from the Atlantic may be interrupted by [[Arctic]] air from the north-east or hot air from the [[Sahara]].

==Politics==
[[File:Westminster palace.jpg|left|thumb|[[Westminster]], [[London]] has the clock tower, which holds the bell [[Big Ben]]]]

The UK is a [[parliament]]ary [[democracy]] based on a [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional]] and [[hereditary monarchy]]. The people of the United Kingdom vote for a [[Member of Parliament|members of Parliament]] to speak for them and to make laws for them. Queen [[Elizabeth II]] is the [[monarch|queen]] of the UK and is the [[head of state]]. Even though she is the head of state, she does not actually govern the country. The [[government]], led by the [[Prime Minister]], governs the country and decides [[policy]]. Today, the Prime Minister is [[Theresa May]], who is the leader of the Conservative [[political party|party]] and was not democratically elected by the people of the country.

[[Parliament]] is where laws are made. It has three parts: the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], the [[House of Lords]], and the Queen. The House of Commons is the most powerful part. It is where Members of Parliament sit. The Prime Minister sits here as well, because he is a Member of Parliament. The people who sit in the House of Lords are called peers: they are not chosen by the people. Most peers are now appointed by the government. There are some who are hereditary [[Peerage|peers]] (their fathers were peers); and a few others, such as certain [[bishop]]s in the established [[Church of England]], and the [[Judiciary]] (Law Lords).

Scotland has its own devolved Parliament with power to make laws on things like education, health and Scottish law. Northern Ireland and Wales have their own devolved Assemblies which have some powers but less than the Scottish parliament. The UK Parliament remains sovereign and it could end the devolved administrations at any time.

==Military==
The UK has a military of around 223,000 people, not including reserve forces. The UK has one of the most advanced military in the world, alongside such countries such as the [[USA]] and [[France]], and operates a large army ([[British Army]]), a sizable navy ([[Royal Navy]]) and air force ([[Royal Air Force]]). From the 18th century to the early 20th century, the UK was one of the most powerful nations in the world, with a huge navy (due to the fact it was surrounded by sea, so a large navy was the most practical option). This status has faded in recent times, but the UK remains a member of various military groups such as the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] and [[NATO]]. It is also still seen as a great military power.

==Economy==
The UK is a [[Development|developed]] country with the sixth largest [[economy]] in the world. It was a [[superpower]] during the 18th, 19th and early 20th century and was considered since the early 1800s to be the most powerful and influential nation in the world, in politics, economics (For it was the wealthiest country at the time.) and in military strength. Britain continued to be the biggest manufacturing economy in the world until 1908 and the largest economy until the 1920s. The economic cost of two world wars and the decline of the [[British Empire]] in the 1950s and 1960s reduced its leading role in global affairs. The UK has strong economic, cultural, military and political influence and is a [[nuclear power]]. It is a member state of the [[European Union]]. The UK holds a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]], and is a member of the [[G8]], [[NATO]], [[World Trade Organization]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

[[London]], the capital, is famous as being the largest centre of [[finance]] in the world, along with [[New York City]] in the [[United States]].

==Literature==
{{see also|English literature}}
[[File:Paget holmes.png|thumb|[[Sherlock Holmes]] and Dr. Watson]]
[[William Shakespeare]] was an [[English people|English]] [[playwright]]. He wrote plays in the late 16th century. Some of his plays were ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Macbeth]]''. In the 19th century, [[Jane Austen]] and [[Charles Dickens]] were novelists. Twentieth century writers include the science fiction novelist [[H.G. Wells]] and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. The children's fantasy ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series was written by [[J.K. Rowling]]. [[Aldous Huxley]] was also from the United Kingdom.

English language literature is written by authors from many countries. Eight people from the United Kingdom have won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. [[Seamus Heaney]] is a writer who was born in [[Northern Ireland]].

[[Arthur Conan Doyle]] from [[Scotland]] wrote the [[Sherlock Holmes]] detective novels. He was from [[Edinburgh]]. The poet [[Dylan Thomas]] brought Welsh culture to international attention.

==Education==
England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales have separate, but similar, systems of education. They all have rules that education is required from ages five to eighteen, except for in Scotland where school departure is allowed from the age of sixteen. Many children attend state schools and other children attend private schools.

Britain's universities are the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford]], and London universities ([[University College London]], the [[London School of Economics and Political Science|London School of Economics]], [[King's College London]] and [[Imperial College London]]) which collectively form the 'Golden Triangle' of UK universities.

A broader group of twenty universities form the [[Russell Group]], which account for two thirds of research grants and contract funding out of the total of 100 universities.

==Transport==
Road traffic in the United Kingdom drives on the left hand side of the road (unlike the Americas and some of the rest of Europe), and the driver steers from the right hand side of the vehicle. The road network on the island of [[Great Britain]] is extensive, with most local and rural roads having evolved from Roman and Medieval times. Major routes developed in the mid 20th Century were made to the needs of the motor car. The high speed [[motorway]] (freeway) network was mostly constructed in the 1960s and 1970s and links together major towns and cities.

The system of [[rail transport]] was invented in England and Wales, so the United Kingdom has the oldest [[railway]] network in the world. It was built mostly during the Victorian era. At the heart of the network are five long distance main lines which radiate from [[London]] to the major cities and secondary population centres with dense commuter networks within the regions. The newest part of the network connects London to the Channel Tunnel from St Pancras station and is built to the same standard as the French TGV system. The [[British Rail]] network is part privatised, with privately owned train operating companies providing service along particular lines or regions, whilst the tracks, signals and stations are owned by a Government controlled company called Network Rail. The system of underground railways in London, known as the [[London Underground|Tube]], has been copied by many other cities.

Most domestic [[air travel]] in the United Kingdom is between London and the major cities in Scotland and the North of England. [[London Heathrow Airport|London-Heathrow]] is the nation’s largest airport and is one of the most important international [[Airline hub|hub]]s in the world. Other major airports with principal international service include London-Gatwick, Birmingham, Manchester and Glasgow.

An extensive system of [[ferry]] networks operate between the Scottish islands, and major ferry routes operate between England and France (via the English Channel), Scotland-Northern Ireland (via the Irish Sea) and England/Wales-Republic of Ireland (from Liverpool/Holyhead).

[[Astronomers]] can use [[telescopes]] to look at very distant galaxies. Like this they see what the universe looked like a long time ago. This is because the light from distant parts of the universe takes a very long time to reach us. From these observations, it seems the [[physical law]]s and [[constant]]s of the universe have not changed.

Physicists are currently unsure if anything existed before the Big Bang. They are also unsure whether the size of the universe is infinite.

== History ==
Many people in history had ideas to explain the universe. Most early [[wikt:model|model]]s had the Earth at the centre of the Universe. Some [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] thought that the Universe has infinite space and has existed forever. They thought it had a set of [[sphere]]s which corresponded to the fixed stars, the [[Sun]] and various [[planet]]s. The spheres circled about a spherical but unmoving [[Earth]]. 

Over the centuries, better observations and better ideas of gravity led to [[Copernicus]]'s [[Sun]]-centred model. This was hugely controversial at the time, and was fought long and hard by authorities of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Christian church]] (see [[Giordano Bruno]] and [[Galileo]]).

The invention of the [[telescope]] in the [[Netherlands]], 1608, was a milestone in astronomy. By the mid-19th century they were good enough for other galaxies to be distinguished. The modern optical (uses visible light) telescope is still more advanced. Meanwhile, the [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] [[dynamics]] ([[equation]]s) showed how the [[Solar System]] worked. 

The improvement of telescopes led astronomers to realise that the Solar System is in a [[galaxy]] made of billions of stars, the [[Milky Way]], and that other galaxies exist outside it, as far as we can see. Careful studies of the distribution of these galaxies and their [[spectral line]]s have led to much of [[physical cosmology|modern cosmology]]. Discovery of the [[redshift]] showed that the Universe is expanding (see [[Hubble]]). 

[[File:HubbleUltraDeepFieldwithScaleComparison.jpg|thumb|right|200px|High-resolution image of the [[Hubble]] ultra deep field. It shows a variety of [[Galaxy|galaxies]], each made of [[wikt:billion|billion]]s of [[star]]s. The equivalent area of sky that the picture occupies is shown in the lower left corner. The smallest, reddest galaxies, about 100, are some of the most distant galaxies to have been photographed. They formed shortly after the Big Bang.]]

=== Big Bang ===
The most used scientific model of the Universe is known as the [[Big bang|Big Bang]] theory. The Universe [[wikt:expanded|expanded]] from a very hot, dense phase called the [[Planck epoch]], in which all the matter and energy of the Universe was concentrated. Several independent experimental measurements support the expansion of space and, more generally, the Big Bang idea. Recent observations support the idea that this expansion is happening because of [[dark energy]]. Most of the matter in the Universe may be in a form which cannot be detected by present methods. This has been named [[dark matter]].

Just to be clear, dark matter and energy have not been detected directly (that is why they are called 'dark'). Their existence is [[inference|inferred]] by [[deduction]] from observations which would be difficult to explain otherwise.

Current thinking in cosmology is that the [[age of the Universe]] is 13.73 (± 0.12) billion years,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/science/space/09cosmos.html|title=Gauging Age of Universe Becomes More Precise|last=Chang|first=Kenneth|date=2008-03-09|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-09-24}}</ref> and that the diameter of the Universe is at least 93 billion [[light year]]s, or 8.80 {{E|26}} [[metre]]s.<ref name=ly93>{{cite web | last = Lineweaver | first = Charles | coauthors = Tamara M.

According to [[general relativity]], space can get bigger faster than the speed of light, but we can view only part of the universe because of the speed of light. We cannot see space beyond the limitations of light (or any [[electromagnetic radiation]]).

== Etymology, synonyms and meaning ==
The word ''Universe'' comes from the [[Old French]] word ''Univers'', which comes from the [[Latin]] word ''universum''.<ref>''The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary'', volume II, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971, p.3518.</ref> The Latin word was used by [[Cicero]] and later Latin authors in many of the same senses as the modern [[English language|English]] word is used. 

A different [[wikt:interpretation|interpretation]] (way to interpret) of ''unvorsum'' is "everything rotated as one" or "everything rotated by one". This refers to an early Greek model of the Universe. In that model, all matter was in rotating spheres centered on the Earth; according to [[Aristotle]], the rotation of the outermost sphere was [[wikt:responsible|responsible]] for the motion and change of everything within. It was natural for the Greeks to assume that the Earth was stationary and that the heavens rotated about the [[Earth]], because careful [[astronomy|astronomical]] and physical measurements (such as the [[Foucault pendulum]]) are required to prove otherwise.

The most common term for "Universe" among the ancient Greek philosophers from [[Pythagoras]] onwards was ''το παν'' (The All), defined as all matter (''το ολον'') and all space (''το κενον'').<ref>Liddell and Scott, pp.1345–1346.</ref>

=== Broadest meaning ===
The broadest word meaning of the Universe is found in ''[[De divisione naturae]]'' by the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[philosopher]] [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], who defined it as simply everything: everything that exists and everything that does not exist.

Time is not considered in Eriugena's definition; thus, his definition includes everything that exists, has existed and will exist, as well as everything that does not exist, has never existed and will never exist. This all-embracing definition was not adopted by most later philosophers, but something [[wikt:similar|similar]] is in [[quantum physics]].<ref name="path_integral">{{cite book | author = Feynman RP, Hibbs AR | year = 1965 | title = Quantum physics and path integrals | publisher = McGraw–Hill | location = New York | isbn = 0-07-020650-3}}<br />{{cite book | author = Zinn Justin J | year = 2004 | title = Path integrals in quantum mechanics | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-856674-3 | oclc = 212409192}}</ref>

=== Definition as reality ===
{{See also|Reality|Physics}}

Usually the Universe is thought to be everything that exists, has existed, and will exist.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Oxford companion to cosmology|authors=Andrew Liddle, Jon Loveday|isbn=978-0-19-956084-4}}</ref> This definition says that the Universe is made of two elements: [[Space (physics)|space]] and [[time]], together known as [[space-time]] or the [[vacuum]]; and [[matter]] and different forms of [[energy]] and [[momentum]] [[wikt:occupying|occupying]] [[space-time]]. The two kinds of elements behave according to [[physical law]]s, in which we describe how the elements interact. 

A similar definition of the term ''Universe'' is everything that exists at a single moment of time, such as the present or the beginning of time, as in the sentence "The Universe was of size 0".

In [[Aristotle]]'s book ''The Physics'', Aristotle divided το ''παν'' (everything) into three roughly analogous elements: ''matter'' (the stuff of which the Universe is made), ''form'' (the arrangement of that matter in space) and ''change'' (how matter is created, destroyed or altered in its properties, and similarly, how form is altered). [[Physical law]]s were the rules governing the properties of matter, form and their changes. Later philosophers such as [[Lucretius]], [[Averroes]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]] altered or refined these divisions. For example, Averroes and Spinoza have ''active'' principles governing the Universe which act on ''passive'' elements.

=== Space-time definitions ===
It is possible to form [[space-time]]s, each existing but not able to touch, move, or change ([[wikt:interact|interact]] with each other. An easy way to think of this is a group of separate [[soap bubble]]s, in which people living on one soap bubble cannot interact with those on other soap bubbles. According to one common terminology, each "soap bubble" of space-time is denoted as a universe, whereas our particular [[space-time]] is denoted as ''the Universe'', just as we call our moon ''the [[Moon]]''. The entire collection of these separate space-times is denoted as the [[multiverse]].<ref name="EllisKS03">{{cite journal| last = Ellis G.F.R; Kirchner U. & Stoeger W.R. 2004 | title = Multiverses and physical cosmology | journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume = 347 | pages = 921–936 | url = http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0305292 | doi =10.1111/j.1365-2966.2004.07261.x | format = subscription required}}</ref> In principle, the other unconnected universes may have different [[dimension]]alities and [[topology|topologies]] of [[space-time]], different forms of [[matter]] and [[energy]], and different [[physical law]]s and [[physical constant]]s, although such possibilities are [[speculation]]s.

=== Observable reality ===
According to a still-more-restrictive definition, the Universe is everything within our connected [[space-time]] that could have a chance to interact with us and vice versa. 

According to the [[general relativity|general idea of relativity]], some regions of [[Outer space|space]] may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe, due to the finite [[speed of light]] and the ongoing expansion of space. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even if the Universe would exist forever; space may expand faster than light can traverse it. 

It is worth emphasizing that those distant regions of space are taken to exist and be part of reality as much as we are; yet we can never interact with them, even in principle.<ref>Even with most of the visible universe, we cannot interact with it in practice. A relatively simple task, so it might seem, would be to communicate within our own galaxy. Even if we knew how to send a message successfully, it would be about 200,000 years before a reply could come back from the far end of the Milky Way, whose diameter is 100,000 [[light year]]s. galaxy.</ref> The spatial region within which we can affect and be affected is denoted as the ''observable universe''. 

Strictly speaking, the observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of space-time than an observer who remains still, so that the observable universe for the former is larger than for the latter. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler may not be able to interact with all of space. Typically, the 'observable universe' means the universe seen from our vantage point in the Milky Way Galaxy.

== Basic data on the Universe ==
[[File:Cosmological composition.jpg|thumb|300px|The universe is thought to be mostly made of [[dark energy]] and [[dark matter]], both of which are not understood right now. ''Less than 5% of the universe is ordinary matter''.]]

The universe has not been the same at all times in its history. This getting bigger accounts for how Earth-bound people can see the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away, even if that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion is consistent with the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been [[redshift]]ed; the [[photon]]s emitted have been stretched to longer [[wavelength]]s and lower [[frequency]] during their journey. The rate of this spatial expansion is accelerating, based on studies of Type Ia [[supernova]]e and other data.

== Theoretical models ==
=== General theory of relativity ===
{{Main|General relativity|}}

Accurate predictions of the universe's past and future require an accurate theory of gravitation. The best theory available is [[Albert Einstein]]'s general theory of relativity, which has passed all experimental tests so far. However, since rigorous experiments have not been carried out on ''cosmological'' length scales, general relativity could conceivably be inaccurate. Nevertheless, its predictions appear to be consistent with observations, so there is no reason to adopt another theory.

General relativity provides of a set of ten nonlinear partial differential equations for the spacetime metric ([[Einstein field equations|Einstein's field equations]]) that must be solved from the distribution of [[mass-energy]] and [[momentum]] throughout the universe. Since these are unknown in exact detail, cosmological models have been based on the [[cosmological principle]], which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic. In effect, this principle asserts that the gravitational effects of the various galaxies making up the universe are equivalent to those of a fine dust distributed uniformly throughout the universe with the same average density. The assumption of a uniform dust makes it easy to solve Einstein's field equations and predict the past and future of the universe on cosmological time scales.

Einstein's field equations include a [[cosmological constant]] (Lamda: ''Λ''),<ref name="einstein_1917">Einstein A. 1917. "Kosmologische Betrachtungen zur allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie". ''Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften, Sitzungsberichte'' 1917 (part 1): 142–152.

=== Big Bang model ===
{{Main|Big Bang|Nucleosynthesis}}

The prevailing Big Bang model accounts for many of the experimental observations described above, such as the correlation of distance and [[redshift]] of galaxies, the universal ratio of hydrogen:helium atoms, and the ubiquitous, isotropic microwave radiation background. As noted above, the redshift arises from the [[metric expansion of space]]; as the space itself expands, the wavelength of a [[photon]] traveling through space likewise increases, decreasing its energy. The longer a photon has been traveling, the more expansion it has undergone; hence, older photons from more distant galaxies are the most red-shifted. Determining the correlation between distance and redshift is an important problem in experimental [[physical cosmology]].

Other experimental observations can be explained by combining the overall expansion of space with [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[atomic physics]]. As the universe expands, the energy density of the [[electromagnetic radiation]] decreases more quickly than does that of [[matter]], since the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. Thus, although the energy density of the universe is now dominated by matter, it was once dominated by radiation; poetically speaking, all was [[light]]. As the universe expanded, its energy density decreased and it became cooler; as it did so, the [[elementary particle]]s of matter could associate stably into ever larger combinations. Thus, in the early part of the matter-dominated era, stable [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s formed, which then associated into [[atomic nuclei]]. At this stage, the matter in the universe was mainly a hot, dense [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of negative [[electron]]s, neutral [[neutrino]]s and positive nuclei. [[Nuclear reaction]]s among the nuclei led to the present abundances of the lighter nuclei, particularly [[hydrogen]], [[deuterium]], and [[helium]]. Eventually, the electrons and nuclei combined to form stable atoms, which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation; at this point, the radiation decoupled from the matter, forming the ubiquitous, isotropic background of microwave radiation observed today.
[[File:Primordial nucleosynthesis.svg|thumb|250px|Chief nuclear reactions responsible for the relative amounts of light [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] observed in the universe.]]

Other observations are not clearly answered by known physics. According to the prevailing theory, a slight imbalance of [[matter]] over [[antimatter]] was present in the universe's creation, or developed very shortly thereafter. Although the matter and antimatter mostly annihilated one another, producing [[photon]]s, a small residue of matter survived, giving the present matter-dominated universe. 

Several lines of evidence also suggest that a rapid [[cosmic inflation]] of the universe occurred very early in its history (roughly 10<sup>−35</sup> seconds after its creation). Recent observations also suggest that the [[cosmological constant]] (''Λ'') is not zero and that the net [[mass-energy]] content of the universe is dominated by a [[dark energy]] and [[dark matter]] that have not been characterized scientifically. They differ in their gravitational effects. Dark matter gravitates as ordinary matter does, and thus slows the expansion of the universe; by contrast, dark energy serves to accelerate the universe's expansion.

== Multiverse ==
{{Main|Multiverse}}

Some people think that there is more than one Universe. They think that there is a [[set theory|set]] of universes called the [[multiverse]]. By definition, there is no way for anything in one universe to affect something in another.
The multiverse is not yet a scientific idea because there is no way to test it. An idea that cannot be tested is not science.

[[Measure]]ment is a process that uses [[number]]s to describe things based on what we can [[observation|observe]] about them. This is done to be able to compare them to each other.  We can measure how big things are, how warm they are, how heavy they are, and lots of other features as well.  '''Units of Measurement''' provide standards for our comparisons, so that the numbers from our measurements refer to the same thing. For example, the [[metre]] is a standard unit to measure [[length]]. Before 1982, it was defined as the distance between two markers on a special rod. Now scientists define the metre as a fraction of the [[speed]] of [[light]].

Saying something has a length of 2 metres means that it is exactly twice as long as that rod used to define the metre, or that light takes twice the time defined for a metre to travel that distance.

Today, most units of measure fall into one of three [[System of measurement|systems]]. The older two, the [[Imperial units|British imperial system]] and the closely related [[United States customary units|US customary system]] use the [[Foot (unit of length)|foot]] as a measure of length, the [[Pound (mass)|pound]] as a measure for [[weight]] and the [[second]] as a measure for time. There are other units as well. In these systems the number of smaller units that make the bigger units varies. For example, there are 12 [[inch]]es in a foot and 16 [[ounce]]s in a pound. A newer system is the [[metric system]] or [[SI units|SI system]] which usually use 10 of the smaller unit to make the bigger one. It uses the metre for length, the [[kilogram]] for weight, and, as with the others, the second for time.

==Number and Unit of measure==
The property of the thing being measured is given as a [[number]] of units of measure. The number only has [[sense]] when the unit of measurement is also given.

For example, The [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]], [[France]] is 300 [[metre|meters]] [[height|tall]].<ref>A person can also say "The Eiffel Tower's [[height]] is 300 meters."</ref> That is, the [[distance]] from the top to the bottom of the Eiffel Tower is 300 meters. The property of the Eiffel Tower being measured is a distance. The number measured is 300. This number does not make [[sense]] without the unit of measure. The unit of measure is the meter.

==Measurement Standards==

[[Standard]]s are special objects that are used to make measurements in terms of fixed units of measurement.  A metre stick is an example of a standard.  When you measure something with a metre stick, you can compare that measurement to anything else that is also measured with a metre stick. This makes measurement [[easier]] and [[wikt:comparison|comparisons]] between measurements easier.<ref>'''An example of unit of measurement standards:'''<br>
David is making a [[house]]. David wants a [[window]] in his house. David makes a hole in the [[wall]] of his house for a window. David measures the hole using the [[length]] of his arm as a unit of measurement. The hole is one [[arm]] [[wikt:tall|tall]] and two arms [[wide]].<br>
<br>
Abbie makes windows. Abbie measures her windows using her arm as a unit of measurement. Some of Abbie's windows are two arms wide and one arm tall.<br> 
<br>
David [[buy]]s a window from Abbie that Abbie says is two arms wide and one arm tall. If David's arms are a different length than Abbie's arms, then the window will be the wrong size.<br> 
<br>
For David to get the right size window, he has to tell the people with the windows what size the hole is. The easy way to do this is for David and Abbie to use the same unit of measurement standard. If David and Abbie both use the meter, they will both know the size of the hole and the size of the windows.<br> 
<br>
Michael wants to use the same window in his house ten years later. Michael makes a hole in his house wall. If the unit of measurement changed in ten years, then Michael would have to remeasure the window. The easiest way to do this is if the unit of measurement did not change in ten years.</ref>

==Size of Units of Measurement==

There are units of measurement of different sizes. There are small units of measurement to measure small things. There are big units of measurement to measure big things.

[[Science]], [[medicine]] and [[engineering]] use smaller units of measurement to measure small things with less [[error]]. It is [[easier]] to measure large things using larger units of measurement.  Large measurements like the [[width]] of a [[galaxy]] and small measurements like the [[mass]] of an [[atom]] use special units of measurement.

==Systems of Units of Measurement==
There are many different standards and units used all over the world.

===Metric System===
:''see [[SI]] and [[Metric system]]''

The [[metric system]] is a system of measurement used in most of the [[earth|world]]. It is also called the International System of Units, or [[SI]].

Units of measure in the metric system include:

*The units of [[length]] or [[linear size]] are based on the [[metre]]. They include the [[kilometre]] (''km'') which is 1000 meters, the [[centimetre]] (''cm''), and the [[millimetre]] (''mm'') which is 1/1000th of a meter.

*The unit of [[volume]] is the [[litre]]. It is used for measuring an amount of [[liquid]].  A [[millilitre]] ([[abbreviate]]d as ''ml'') is the amount of liquid that would fill up a [[cube]] that measures 1 centimetre on each side. One l litre of liquid would fill up a [[cube]] that is 10&nbsp;cm on each side.

*The unit of [[mass]] is the [[kilogram]].  A kilogram (''kg'') weighs the same as a litre of water (at normal temperature, and pressure). 1 gram (''g'') is the weight of 1 millilitre of [[water]] at 0 degrees [[Celsius]].  The metric [[tonne]] is 1000 kilograms or a [[million]] grams.

===British imperial Units===
{{main|imperial units}}
Imperial units were defined in the United Kingdom in 1825. These units sometimes based on similar units that were in use before 1825. Imperial units were used in countries that were part of the [[British Empire]]. While many of these countries, including the United Kingdom, have officially adopted SI, the older system of units are still used.

===US customary units===
{{main|United States customary units}}
US customary units are the official units used in the US. These are similar to the British imperial units and also based on the units used in the United Kingdom from before [[American Independence]]. But some of the units are different to the British ones. For example, there are 20 imperial fluid ounces in an imperial pint, but 16 US fluid ounces in a US pint. Additionally, the US fluid ounce is slightly bigger than the imperial fluid ounce. The result is that US pints and gallons are smaller than imperial pints and gallons. In the United States, the metric system has been legal for trade since 1866 but other measurements such as the gallon, inch, and the pound are still widely used.

Imperial and US units of measurement include:
*Length - [[inch]] (''in''), [[Foot (unit of length)|foot]] (''ft''), [[yard]] (''yd''), and [[mile]].
**1 foot = 12 inches
**1 yard = 3 feet (plural of foot) = 36 inches
**1 mile = 1760 yards = 5280 feet

*Imperial volume - [[imperial fluid ounce]] (''fl oz''), [[imperial pint]] (''pt''), and [[imperial gallon]] (''gal'').
**1 imperial pint = 20 imperial fluid ounces
**1 imperial gallon = 8 imperial pints

*US volume - US fluid ounces (''fl oz''), [[Cup (unit)|US cup]] (''cp''), [[US pint]] (''pt''), [[US quart]] (''qt''), and [[US gallon]] (''gal'').
**1 US cup = 8 US fluid ounces
**1 US pint = 2 US cups = 16 US fluid ounces
**1 US quart = 2 US pints
**1 US gallon = 4 US quarts = 8 US pints

*[[Weight]] and [[mass]] are measured in ounces (''oz'') and pounds (''lb''), and [[stone (unit)|stone]] (''st'') in imperial only.
**1 pound = 16 ounces
**1 stone = 14 pounds

The ounces for weight and volume are different. Even when measuring [[water]], the number of ounces of weight is not the same as the number of fluid ounces.

===Converting Between Systems===
;Metric to US
*1 meter = 1.09 yards = 39.37 inches.
*1 liter = 33.3 fluid ounces = 1.76 pints = .26 US gallons.
*1 kilogram = 35.32 ounces = 2.2 pounds

;US to metric
*Length
**1 inch = 2.54 centimetres
**1 foot = 30.48 centimetres
**1 yard = .914 metres
**1 mile = 1.61 kilometres
*Volume
**1 fluid ounce = 29.6 millilitres
**1 pint = 473.1 millilitres
**1 gallon = 3.79 litres
**1 cup = 16 ounces
*Mass
**1 ounce = 28.35 grams
**1 pound = .45 kilograms

== Other Units of Measure==
===Time===
The unit of [[time]] is the [[second]].  The [[minute]] (60 seconds) and [[hour]] (60 minutes or 3600 seconds) are larger units.  A [[day]] is usually said to be 24 hours, but is actually a little bit longer than that.  This difference is corrected at the end of some [[year|years]] with what is called a leap second.  A [[week]] (7 days) and [[month]] are also standard units.

===Money===
A unit of measurement that applies to [[money]] is called a [[unit of account]].  This is normally a [[currency]] issued by a [[country]].  For instance, the [[United States]] use [[U.S. Dollar|dollars]]. Each dollar is 100 cents. The [[United Kingdom]] uses [[British pound|pounds]]. Each pound is 100 pennies or [[pence]]. Other countries in [[Europe]] use the [[Euro]] which is 100 cent for the Euro (they are not called "cents")

[[Category:Units of measurement| ]]

[[ar:قياسات]]
[[tr:Ölçüm]]'''U.S customary units''' is the [[system of measurement|system of units of measurement]] used to [[measurement|measure]] things in the [[United States]]. The system of [[Imperial units]] is similar and in some parts identical.

Length or distance units include the [[inch]], [[Foot (unit of length)|foot]], [[Yard (unit of length)|yard]] and [[mile]].

Land units include '''square miles''' (2589998.47032 square meter) and '''acres''' (4046.8726 square meter).

Common [[volume]] units are the '''teaspoon''', '''tablespoon''' (3 teaspoons), '''fluid ounce''' (two tablespoons), '''[[Cup (unit)|cup]]''' (8 ounces), '''[[pint]]''' (2 cups, or 16 fluid ounces), '''quart''' (2 pints, or 32 fluid ounces), US [[gallon]] (16 cups, 128 fluid ounces, or 3.8 [[litre|liter]]s).

A [[barrel (unit)|barrel]] is the unit to measure [[oil]].

Temperature is measured in degrees [[Fahrenheit]] (°F). To convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit: take the Celsius, multiply by nine, divide by five, and add thirty-two.

Units of [[weight]] include the '''pound''' (453.6 [[gram]]s), which contains 16 ounces. This should not be confused with the [[British pound]] which is a type of money. The different uses of the word ''pound'' can cause confusion.

Some people have been trying change these units in favour of the [[SI|metric system]] since the [[1820s]]. Much [[infrastructure]] was built in past centuries using the old measures by both British and Americans. During the 20th century some segments such as science, medicine and the [[military of the United States]] converted to the metric system but the old units are still used for daily purposes by Americans. On the other hand, world trade is conducted using the metric system and except for the U.S., the world uses the metric system for all purposes.

'''Uranus''' is the seventh [[planet]] from the [[Sun]] in the [[Solar System]].  It is a [[gas giant]]. It is the third largest planet in the solar system. The planet is made of [[ice]], [[gas]]es and [[liquid]] [[metal]]. Its [[atmosphere]] contains [[hydrogen]], [[helium]] and [[methane]]. The [[temperature]] on Uranus is −197 degrees [[celsius|C]] (79&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]) near the top of its atmosphere, but its small solid core (about 55% the mass of Earth) is probably about 5,000K.  The planet is [[axial tilt-|tilted]] on its [[Axis (mathematics)|axis]] so much that it is sideways.

Uranus completes its [[orbit]]  around the Sun in 84 earth years. It completes its turn around itself in 17 hours and 14 minutes. This means there are about 43,000 [[day]]s in 1 uranian [[year]].<ref>library.thinkquest.org/C005921/Uranus/uranLocOrb.htm</ref>

The distance between Uranus and [[Neptune]] is 1.6 billion [[kilometer|km]]. Uranus was discovered in [[1781]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Peter|coauthors=Time-Life Books|title=Age of Enlightenment|year=1966|publisher=Time|pages=25|chapter=The Practical Philosophers}}</ref> Uranus has 13 known rings which are hard to see from earth.

This planet can be seen with the naked eye under perfect conditions. Some evidence suggests that this planet was catalogued as a star (34 Tauri) before its confirmed discovery. {{fact|date=July 2010}}

Uranus is named after the Greek [[Uranos|god Uranus]], who was a [[god]] of [[sky]].

== Moons ==
Uranus has 27 known [[Natural satellite|moons]]. The names for these moons are chosen from characters from the works of [[Shakespeare]] and [[Alexander Pope]].<ref name=Faure2007>{{cite encyclopedia|last= Faure|first=Gunter|coauthors=Mensing, Teresa|title=Uranus: What Happened Here?|encyclopedia=Introduction to Planetary Science|year=2007|publisher=Springer Netherlands|editor=Faure, Gunter; Mensing, Teresa M.|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-5544-7_18}}</ref><ref name=Nineplanets>{{cite web |title=Uranus |url=http://www.nineplanets.org/uranus.html|publisher=nineplanets.org |accessdate=2007-07-03}}</ref>

The five biggest moons are [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]], [[Ariel (moon)|Ariel]], [[Umbriel (moon)|Umbriel]], [[Titania (moon)|Titania]] and [[Oberon (moon)|Oberon]]. Many moons have yet to be discovered. They remain a mystery.

== Exploring ==
In 1986, [[NASA]]'s ''[[Voyager 2]]'' visited Uranus. The visit is the only attempt to investigate the planet from a short distance.

== Clouds ==
Uranus is covered in blue clouds. The clouds, made of methane, are difficult to see as they are low in the atmosphere.<ref>{{Cite web

== Rings ==
[[File:Uranian rings scheme.png|100px|left|thumb|The scheme of Uranus's ring-moon system. Solid lines denote rings; dashed lines denote orbits of moons]]

The planet '''Uranus''' has a system made of '''13 rings''' between the more extensive set around [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]] and the simpler systems around [[Jupiter]] and [[Neptune]]. The rings of Uranus were discovered in 1977.<ref name=Elliot1977>{{cite web|title=The rings of Uranus|author=Elliot J.L; Dunham, E. & Mink D.|work= Cornell University|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v267/n5609/abs/267328a0.html|year=1977|accessdate=June 9, 2007}}</ref> More than 200 years ago, William Herschel also reported observing rings, but modern astronomers do not believe that he saw them, because they are very dark and faint.

=== Origins ===
The rings of Uranus are thought to be relatively young, not more than 600 million years old. The Uranian ring system probably began from the collisional fragmentation of moons that once existed around the planet. After colliding, the moons probably broke up into many particles, which survived as narrow, optically dense rings only in zones of maximum [[stability]].

=== General properties ===
[[File:Uranian rings PIA01977.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Uranus's inner rings. The bright outer ring is the epsilon ring; eight other rings are visible]]

The ring system of Uranus has thirteen distinct rings. In order of increasing distance from the planet they are: 1986U2R/ζ, 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, λ, ε, ν, μ rings. They can be divided into three groups: nine narrow main rings (6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, ε), two dusty rings (1986U2R/ζ, λ) and two outer rings (μ, ν). The rings of Uranus   consist mainly of macroscopic particles and  little [[dust]], although dust is known to be present in 1986U2R/ζ, η, δ, λ, ν and μ rings. 

In addition to these well-known rings, there may be numerous optically thin dust bands and faint rings between them. These faint rings and dust bands may exist only temporarily. Some of them became visible during a series of ring plane-crossing events in 2007.<ref name=dePater2007>{{cite journal|last=de Pater|first=Imke|coauthors=Hammel H B. ''et al'' |title=The dark side of the rings of Uranus |journal=Science|year=2007|volume=317|pages=1888–1890 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007Sci...317.1888D| doi=10.1126/science.1148103|pmid=17717152|issue=5846}}</ref> A number of dust bands between the rings were observed in forward-scattering {{Ref_label|A|a|none}} geometry by ''[[Voyager 2]]''.  All rings of Uranus show [[azimuth]]al brightness variations.

The rings are made of an extremely dark material. The rings are slightly red in the [[ultraviolet]] and visible parts of the [[spectrum]] and grey in [[near-infrared]].<ref name=Baines1998>{{cite journal|last=Baines|first=Kevin H. ''et al''  |title=Near-Infrared absolute photometric imaging of the Uranian system |journal=Icarus|year=1998|volume=132 |pages=266–284|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998Icar..132..266B|doi=10.1006/icar.1998.5894}}</ref> They show no identifiable [[spectrum analysis|spectral features]]. The [[chemical composition]] of the ring particles is not known. However, they cannot be made of pure water ice like the [[rings of Saturn]] because they are too dark, darker than the [[moons of Uranus|inner moons of Uranus]]. This shows that they are probably composed of a mixture of the ice and a dark material. The nature of this material is not clear, but it may be [[organic compound]]s considerably darkened by the [[charged particle]] irradiation from the Uranian [[magnetosphere]]. The rings' particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially similar to that of the inner moons.<ref name=Baines1998/>
[[File:Uranus Orbit.gif|thumb|Uranus revolves around the Sun once every 84 Earth years. Its average distance from the Sun is roughly 3 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]]&nbsp;km (about 20 [[Astronomical Units|AU]])]] [[File:Uranusandrings.jpg|thumb|A 1998 false-colour near-[[infrared]] image of Uranus showing [[cloud]] bands, [[planetary ring|rings]], and [[Natural satellite|moons]] obtained by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s [[Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer|NICMOS camera]]]]

As a whole, the ring system of Uranus is unlike either the faint dusty [[rings of Jupiter]] or the broad and complex [[rings of Saturn]], some of which are composed of very bright material—water ice. However, there are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system; the Saturnian [[F ring]] and the ε ring are both narrow, relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons. The newly discovered outer rings of Uranus are similar to the outer G and E rings of [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]. Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian rings also resemble the narrow rings of Uranus. In addition, dust bands observed between the main rings of Uranus may be similar to the rings of Jupiter. In contrast, the [[Rings of Neptune|Neptunian ring]] system is quite similar to that of Uranus, although it is less complex, darker and contains more dust. The Neptunian rings are also positioned further from the planet.

== Orbit and rotation ==
Uranus revolves around the Sun once every 84 Earth years. Its average distance from the Sun is roughly 3 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]]&nbsp;km (about 20 [[Astronomical Units|AU]]). The intensity of sunlight on Uranus is about 1/400 that on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Next Stop Uranus| url=http://www.astrosociety.org/education/publications/tnl/04/04.html|year=1986|accessdate=June 9, 2007}}</ref> Its orbital elements were first calculated in 1783 by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].<ref>Forbes, George 1909. ''History of Astronomy''.</ref> With time, discrepancies began to appear between the predicted and observed orbits, and in 1841, [[John Couch Adams]] first proposed that the differences might be due to the gravitational tug of an unseen planet. In 1845, [[Urbain Le Verrier]] began his own independent research into Uranus's orbit. On September 23, 1846, [[Johann Gottfried Galle]] [[Discovery of Neptune|located a new planet]], later named [[Neptune]], at nearly the position predicted by Le Verrier.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mathematical discovery of planets|author=O'Connor, J J and Robertson, E F|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/Neptune_and_Pluto.html|year=1996|accessdate=June 13, 2007}}</ref>

The rotational period of the interior of Uranus is 17&nbsp;hours, 14&nbsp;minutes, clockwise ([[retrograde motion|retrograde]]). As on all [[giant planet]]s, its upper atmosphere experiences very strong winds in the direction of rotation. At some latitudes, such as about two-thirds of the way from the equator to the south pole, visible features of the atmosphere move much faster, making a full rotation in as little as 14 hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=Uranus|work=NASA World Book|author=Peter J.

[[Category:Uranus (planet)| ]][[File:A lecture at the University of West London, Ealing Campus.jpg|thumb|280px|A lecture at the University of West London.]]
A '''university''' is an institution where teaching and research is done. The word ''university'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''universitas magistrorum et scholarium'', roughly meaning "community of teachers and [[academia|scholars]]." <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=5vgGE8_CGOEC&pg=PA748&lpg=PA748&dq=community+of+teachers+and+scholars+universitas+magistrorum+et+scholarium&source=web&ots=Q-K88OdXyH&sig=YqFluZHNcSWstv1oApgs34cMUdQ Google eBook of '''''Encyclopedia Britannica''''']</ref> People can attend university to get a degree. Unlike the schooling they have done before, the courses at university are specialized. A person studying [[biology]] at university has lots of courses about biology and not very many courses in other fields, like languages or history. To get a higher degree, people must do some research.

== History ==
[[File:Bologna-vista02.jpg|thumb|Area above the old [[University of Bologna]] buildings, founded in 1088]]
The universities were born in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]. The first institution of this type was the [[University of Bologna]] that later became a model for similar centers of education.<ref>Hunt Janin: "The university in medieval life, 1179–1499", McFarland, 2008, ISBN 0-7864-3462-7, p. 55f.</ref><ref>de Ridder-Symoens, Hilde: [http://books.google.com/books?id=5Z1VBEbF0HAC&printsec=frontcover ''A History of the University in Europe: Volume 1, Universities in the Middle Ages''], Cambridge University Press, 1992, ISBN 0-521-36105-2, pp. 47–55</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wyjnHZ1IIlgC|title=The Challenge of Bologna| author=Paul L. Gaston | year=2010 | pages=18 | isbn=1-57922-366-4}}</ref> This term can often be used in other cultures to mean centers of higher education and higher thought, although their creation was often well before the Middle Ages.

At first, the universities had formed themselves according to the model of the professional groups and like almost everything in the Middle Ages, they remained tied to the [[Catholic Church]]. At the beginning, they had worked to teach the so-called "seven [[liberal arts]]" (the ''trivium'' and the ''quadrivium''):
* ''Trivium'': [[grammar]], [[logic]] and [[rhetoric]].
* ''Quadrivium'': [[arithmetic]] and [[geometry]], [[astronomy]] and [[music]].
That earliest division caused the present divisions between literary and scientific fields.

== Organization ==
A university can include several [[campus]]es, or different places where classes are taught. In each campus there are several [[faculty|faculties]] and university schools (mainly for teaching), and also laboratories, departments and institutes of research. Many campuses also have housing for students in buildings called dormitories and structures like libraries, study rooms, and gymnasiums for students that live there. Each school offers many courses that students take to earn a degree.
The person with the highest right to control and to command in a university is the rector, who governs the university with the help of the party of vice-rectors and of other organs such as the social council and the governing body.

[[Category:Colleges and universities| ]]'''Value''' is how much something is [[wikt:worth|worth]]. Often the best way to find the value of something is to use the [[price]] that it can be [[wikt:sell|sold]] for. However [[Oscar Wilde]] wrote that 'people know the price of everything but the value of nothing'- in other words true value does not depend on money alone.

In [[math]], a value is a number which is concrete, something everyone can agree upon.  However people may disagree on the value of water, depending if you live in a desert or next to a river.  Disagreements on the value of things can create fights between nations, political parties, religions, etc.

'''Volapük''' is a constructed language created in [[1880]] by [[Johann Martin Schleyer]]. Schleyer was a Catholic priest from [[Germany]]. He felt that [[God]] had told him in a dream to make an international language. Volapük [[conventions]] took place in [[1884]], [[1887]], and [[1889]]. The aim was to help people from different cultures speak to each other.

Volapük became less popular after 1887 when [[Esperanto]] was published. Part of the reason was that Esperanto is easier to learn with a simpler [[grammar]]. There are only 25-30 Volapük speakers in the world today.

The vocabulary of Volapük is mostly [[English language|English]], with some words from [[German language|German]] and [[French language|French]]. 

"Vol" and "pük" come from the English words "world" and "speech". The grammar is based on [[Indo-European languages]].

An example of Volapük is the translation of the ''Lord's prayer'':

<poem>
    {{lang|vo|O Fat obas, kel binol in süls, paisaludomöz nem ola! 
    Kömomöd monargän ola! 
    Jenomöz vil olik, äs in sül, i su tal!

A '''vocabulary''' is a list of [[word]]s.

The vocabulary a person uses is all the words that person uses. A person who is five knows 4,000 to 5,000 words.<ref>Nation, Paul, and Robert Waring. 1997. Vocabulary size, text coverage and word lists. ''Vocabulary: Description, acquisition and pedagogy'', 6-19. [http://www.fltr.ucl.ac.be/fltr/germ/etan/bibs/vocab/cup.html]</ref> [[Adult]]s who go to [[college]] may know 20,000 words.<ref>Goulden R; Nation P. & Read J. 1990. How large can a receptive vocabulary be? ''Applied Linguistics'' '''11''': 341-363.</ref>

The number of words in a [[language]] is more than that. A [[dictionary]] is a list of words, and explains the [[meaning]]s of the words. One dictionary may have a list of 500,000 (half a [[million]]) words. Another dictionary may have some other words that the other dictionary does not have. When you add all the words in those dictionaries, there are about 750,000 words in [[English language|English]]. There may be more words than that.<ref name=Crystal>Crystal, David 1995. ''The Cambridge encyclopedia of the English language''. Cambridge University Press, p119, p423.</ref>

If there are 750,000 words, how can we talk with only 3000 words? Because, we do not need all the words. You can say most things with 3000 words.<ref>Adolphs and Schmitt 2003. Lexical coverage of spoken discourse.[http://applij.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/4/425.full.pdf+html]</ref> 

The most used words are short words. That is true in all languages.<ref>Zipf G.K. 1949. ''Human behavior and the principle of least effort''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley.</ref> The 50 most common words in English have less than seven letters. Half of these words have less than four letters.<ref name=Crystal/> 

The vocabulary of a language is always changing.  New words are made or words change their meaning. Words about [[computer]]s, like "download" are new to the [[English language]]. The new word "bling" came from [[hip hop]].  Words like "cool" have developed new meanings.

A '''verb''' is a kind of word ([[part of speech]]) that tells about an [[wikt:action|action]] or a [[wikt:state|state]]. It is the main part of a [[sentence]]:  every sentence has a verb. In [[English language|English]], verbs are the only kind of word that changes to show [[past tense|past]] or present [[Grammatical tense|tense]].<ref name="EngGram">Huddleston R. & Pullum G.K 2005. ''A Student's Introduction to English Grammar.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press</ref> 

Every [[language]] in the world has verbs, but they are not always used in the same ways. They also can have different properties in different languages. For example, in some other languages (e.g., [[Chinese language|Chinese]] & [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]) verbs do not change for past and present tense. This means the [[definition]] above only works well for English verbs.

There are sixteen verbs used in [[Wikipedia:Basic English alphabetical wordlist|Basic English]]. They are: ''[[be]], [[Wikt:do|do]], [[Wikt:have|have]], [[Wikt:come|come]], [[go]], [[see]], [[Wikt:seem|seem]], [[Wikt:give|give]], [[Wikt:take|take]], [[Wikt:keep|keep]], [[Wikt:make|make]], [[Wikt:put|put]], [[Wikt:send|send]], [[Wikt:say|say]], [[Wikt:let|let]], [[Wikt:get|get]].''

== The word 'verb' ==
The word ''verb'' originally comes from ''*were-'', a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word meaning "a word". It comes to English through the Latin ''verbum'' and the Old French ''verbe''.

=== Verbal phrase ===
In [[simple sentence]]s, the verb may be one word: ''The cat ''sat'' on the mat''. However, the verb may be a [[phrase]]: ''The cat ''will sit'' on the mat''. 

Verbal phrases can be extremely difficult to analyse: ''I'm afraid I will need to be going soon''. There seem to be three verbal phrases here, which mean something like ''Sorry, I must go soon''.

== Verb forms ==
In English and many other languages, verbs change their form. This is called [[inflection]]. Most English verbs have six inflected forms (see the table), but ''be'' has eight different forms.

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|+Forms of English verbs
|rowspan="3"|Primary forms || '''past''': walked || She <u>walked</u> home
|-
|'''3rd [[singular]] present''': walks || She <u>walks</u> home
|-
|'''plain [[wikt:present|present]]''': walk || They <u>walk</u> home
|-
|rowspan="3"|Secondary forms || '''plain form''': walk || She should <u>walk</u> home
|-
|'''[[gerund]]''': walking || She is <u>walking</u> home
|-
|'''past [[participle]]''': walked || She has <u>walked</u> home
|-
|}

You should notice that some of the verb forms look the same. You can say they have the same '''shape'''. For example, the plain present and the plain form of ''walk'' have the same shape. The same is true for the past and the past [[participle]]. But these different forms can have different shapes in other verbs. For example, the plain present of ''be'' is usually ''are'' but the plain form is ''be''. Also, the past of ''eat'' is ''ate'', but the past participle is ''eaten''. When you look for a verb in the dictionary, it is usually the plain form that you look for.

An English sentence must have at least one primary-form verb. Each main [[clause]] can only have one primary-form verb.

== Kinds of Verbs ==
English has two main kinds of verbs: normal verbs (called [[lexical verb]]s) and [[auxiliary verb]]s. The difference between them is mainly in where they can go in a sentence. Some verbs are in both groups, but there are very few auxiliary verbs in English. There are also two kinds of auxiliary verbs: [[modal verb]]s and non-modal verbs. The table below shows most of the English auxiliaries and a small number of other verbs.

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|+Kinds of English verbs
! colspan="2" | auxiliary verbs !! lexical verbs
|-
!rowspan="5" | modal verbs 
|| '''Can''' you play the piano? || I '''fell'''
|-
| I '''will''' not be there || I didn't '''fall'''
|-
| '''Shall''' we go || I '''had''' breakfast.
|-
| Yes, you '''may''' || I'm '''playing''' soccer.
|-
| You '''must''' be joking || Must you '''make''' that noise?
|-
!rowspan="3" | non-modal verbs 
|| '''Have''' you seen him? || Have you '''seen''' him?
|-
| I '''did''' see it || I did '''see''' it
|-

|}

There are several auxiliary verbs:
* To ''do'' (do, does, did)
* To ''be'' (am, is, are, was, were): Creates a progressive tense
* To '''have''' (have, has, had): Creates a perfect tense

The following verbs are ''modal auxiliaries''.
* Can
* Could
* May
* Might
* Must
* Shall
* Should

Auxiliary verbs also inflect for [[negation]]. Usually this is done by adding ''not'' or ''n't''.<ref name="EngGram"/>
* You should'''n't''' be here.
* He is'''n't''' at home.
* We have'''n't''' started yet.

=== Use of the auxiliary ''do'' ===
Sometimes the verb ''do''.  It does not really change the meaning.
* I ''do'' talk (Present)
* I ''did'' go (Past)

It is also used in the negative when no other auxiliary verbs are used.
* I ''don't'' talk (Present)
* I ''didn't'' go (Past)

Many other languages do not use the verb ''do'' as an auxiliary verb.  They use the simple present for ''do'', and the simple past or perfect for '''did''

== Tense, aspect, and mood ==
Many people think that all different ways of using verbs are all different tenses. This is not true. There are three main systems related to the verb: [[tense (grammar)|tense]], [[aspect (grammar)|aspect]], and [[mood (grammar)|mood]].

=== Tense ===
Tense is mainly used to say '''when''' the verb happens: in the past, present, or future. In order to explain and understand tense, it is useful to imagine time as a line on which [[past tense]], [[present tense]] and [[future tense]] are [[wikt:position|positioned]].<ref>Sangmeister, Lisa. (2009). [http://books.google.com/books?id=guppGxH8DQAC&pg=PA11&dq= ''Past Tense in English: From OE to PDE,'' p. 11].</ref>

Some languages have all three tenses, some have only two, and some have no tenses at all. [[English language|English]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] for example have only two tenses: past and present.<ref name="EngGram"/> [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] verbs do not show tense. Instead they use other words in the sentence to show when the verb happens.

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|+English tenses
![[Past tense]] || [[Present tense]]
|-
| She '''walked''' home ||  She '''walks''' home
|-
| He '''ran''' quickly ||  He '''runs''' quickly
|-
| I '''could''' swim well || I '''can''' swim well
|-
| '''Did''' you live here? || '''Do''' you live here?
|-
|}

=== Aspect ===
Aspect usually shows us things like whether the action is finished or not, or if something happens regularly. English has two [[Grammatical aspect|aspects]]: [[progressive aspect|progressive]] and [[perfect aspect|perfect]]. In English, aspect is usually shown by using participle verb forms. Aspect can combine with present or past tense.

==== Progressive aspect ====
English uses the gerund-participle, usually together with the auxiliary ''be'' (and its forms am, is, are, was, and were) to show the progressive aspect.
* I''''m sleeping'''. (present progressive)
* He '''was studying''' English last night. (past progressive)
* He '''will be going''' to the store tomorrow (future progressive)

Many other languages, such as [[French language|French]], do not use progressive tenses.

* I''''ve seen''' him twice. (present perfect)
* I '''had lived''' there for three years. (past perfect)

The past perfect can be used to express an unrealized hope, wish, etc.
* He '''had intended''' to bake a cake but ran out of flour.
* She '''had wanted'''  to buy him a gift but he refused.

After '''If''', '''wish''' and '''would rather''', the past perfect can be used to talk about past events that never happened.
* '''If''' only I '''had been born''' standing up!
* I '''wish''' you '''had told''' me that before.
* I '''would rather''' you '''had gone''' somewhere else.

=== Mood ===
Finally, English [[mood]] is now usually shown by using [[modal verb]]s. In the past, English had a full mood system but that has almost completely disappeared. The subjunctive mood now uses the plain form. There is also a form of ''be'' that is used in conditionals to show that something is not true (e.g., If I '''were''' a bird, I would fly to California.)

== Sentence parts that go with verbs ==
Certain parts of a sentence naturally come before verbs or after them, but these are not always the same for all verbs. The main sentence parts are: [[subject]], [[object]], [[complement]], and [[modifier]]. 

=== Subjects ===
Almost all English sentences have subjects, but sentences that are orders (called [[imperative]]s) usually do not have any subjects. A subject usually comes before a verb, but it can also come after auxiliary verbs. In the following examples, the subject is underlined and the primary verb is in bold.
* <u>We</u> '''need''' you.
* <u>The food</u> '''was''' good.
* <u>The small boy</u> with red hair '''is''' sleeping.
* '''Can''' <u>you</u> see the car?
* '''Come''' here. (no subject)

=== Objects ===
Many verbs can be followed by an object. These verbs are called [[transitive verb]]s. In fact, some verbs must have an object (e.g., ''take''), but some verbs never take an object (e.g., ''sleep''). Verbs that do not take an object are called [[Transitivity (grammar)|intransitive]] verbs. Some verbs can even have two objects. They are called [[Transitivity (grammar)|ditransitive]] verbs. In the following examples, the object is underlined and the primary verb is in bold.
* I'm sleeping. (no object)
* I '''took''' <u>the book</u> from him.
* I '''gave''' <u>him</u> <u>the book</u>. (2 objects)
* I '''am''' happy. (no object)
* I '''became''' a teacher. (complement, no object)
* I '''slept''' in my bed (1 object)

=== Complements ===
Some verbs can or must be followed by a [[complement]]. These verbs are called [[linking verbs]] or [[copula]]. In the following examples, the complement is underlined and the verb is in bold.
* He '''is''' <u>good</u>.
* He '''is''' <u>a boy</u>.
* She '''became''' <u>sick</u>.
* She '''became''' <u>a manager</u>.
* It '''looks''' <u>nice</u>.

=== Modifiers ===
Verbs can be modified by various [[modifier]]s, mainly [[adverb]]s. Note that verbs generally do not need modifiers; it's usually a choice. In the following examples, the adverb is underlined and the verb is in bold.
* The boy '''ran''' <u>quickly</u>.
* The <u>freely</u> '''swinging''' rope hit him.

Verbs also commonly take a variety of other modifiers including [[preposition]]s.

== Differences between verbs and other kinds of words ==
Sometimes a verb and another word can have the same shape. In these cases you can usually see the difference by looking at various properties of the words.

=== Verbs vs. adjectives ===
Sometimes a verb and an [[adjective]] can have the same shape. Usually this happens with participles. For example, the present participle ''interesting'' and the adjective ''interesting'' look the same. Verbs are different from adjectives, though, because they cannot be modified by ''very'', ''more'', or ''most''.<ref name="EngGram"/> For example, you can say "That is '''very''' interesting," so you know '''interesting''' is an adjective here. But you cannot say "My teacher is very interesting me in math" because in this sentence ''interesting'' is a verb. On the other hand, if you cannot change the 'be' verb to 'seem' or 'become', it is probably a verb. 
* He was isolated / He became isolated (''isolated'' is an adjective)
* The door was opening / *The door became opening (''opening'' is a verb)

=== Verbs vs. nouns ===
The gerund-particle sometimes looks like a [[noun]]. This is especially true when it is used as a subject, as in the following example:
* '''Running''' is good for you.

The main differences between these verbs and nouns are: modifiers, number, and object/complement

==== Modifiers ====
Verbs cannot generally be modified by adjectives and nouns cannot generally be modified by adverbs. So, in "Running regularly is good for you", ''running'' is a verb because it is modified by ''regularly'', an adverb.

==== Number ====
Verbs cannot change for number, so if you can make the word [[plural]], it is a noun, not a verb. For example, "this drawing is nice" can change to "these drawings are nice", so ''drawing'' is a noun. But "drawing trees is fun" cannot change to "drawings trees is fun", so it is a verb here.

==== Object/complement ====
Many verbs can take objects or complements, but nouns cannot.<ref name="EngGram"/> So, in "parking the car is hard", ''parking'' is a verb because it takes the object ''the car''. But, if you say, "there's no parking", parking may be a noun because it does not have an object.

=== Verbs vs. prepositions ===
Some verbs have become [[preposition]]s.<ref name="EngGram"/> Again, usually these share a shape with participles. Here are some examples:
* '''Given''' the problems, I do not think we should go.
* We have many helpers, '''including''' John.''
* '''According''' to the map, we are here.''
* He went to hospital '''following''' the fight.

The main difference between verbs and prepositions is that verbs have a subject. Even if the subject is not written, you can understand what it is. Prepositions do not have a subject.<ref name="EngGram"/>

== References ==
{{reflist}}
{{wiktionary}}

[[Category:Grammar]]:''This article is about physical object; for meaning from audio field, see [[loudness]].''

{{wiktionary}}
The '''volume''' of an object is a measure of the amount of [[Space (physics)|space]] occupied by that object, not to be confused with [[mass]]. The volume of a mountain is much larger than the volume of a rock, for instance.

The word volume implies a [[3-D|three-dimensional]] context where, by convention,
* the [[length]] is the longest distance between the object's extremities
* the [[width]] (or breadth) refers to the size of the object in a direction perpendicular to its length
* the [[height]] (or [[depth]]) stands for the size of that object in the direction perpendicular to both the length and the width.

For objects at or near the [[Earth]]'s surface, height or depth often refers to the dimension of the object along the local vertical. All physical objects occupy a volume, even if some are so thin that they appear to be [[2D|two-dimensional]], like a sheet of paper.

== Units of volume ==
The unit of volume in the [[International System of Units]] is the cubic meter, which is represented by the symbol m<sup>3</sup>.

In some fields or applications, it is convenient to use different units to simplify the discussions or writings. For instance,

* Everyday quantities of [[liquid]]s are often measured in units of a [[litre]], symbol l, which is the volume occupied by a cubic decimetre.
* Large quantities of liquids, such as [[oil]], and sometimes other materials, may be measured and traded in units of [[barrel]]s. There are many different reference volumes called barrels, depending on the nature of the content.

Traditional units are still in encountered in some countries: [[Imperial unit]]s such as the [[gallon]] or the [[fluid ounce]] were in widespread use within the British Empire. Some of them are still popular in the United States, which also uses units like the [[bushel]], or the [[quart]], the cup and the teaspoon (in cooking recipes, for example). See [[U.S. customary units]] for more examples.

== Non-conservation of volume ==
The volume of an object is not a fundamental property of that object: it can change with environmental conditions such as pressure and temperature, especially if the object is highly compressible.

The volume of a mixture of [[fluid]]s (liquids, [[gas]]es) may or may not be equal to the sum of their volumes before they were mixed.

== Measuring a volume ==
The volume of simple geometric objects can often be calculated on the basis of their known dimensions:

* The volume of a perfect cube of side ''c'' is ''c''<sup>3</sup>
* The volume of a parallelepiped of sides ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' is ''a'' &times; ''b'' &times; ''c''
* The volume of a sphere of radius ''r'' is (4/3) π ''r''<sup>3</sup>

The volume of a gas is typically that of its container, but it could be ill-defined, as in the case of the atmosphere, which has no clear upper limit. The volume of a liquid is often measured by pouring it into a graduated container. The volume of a small [[solid]] can be estimated by immersing it into a graduated container partially filled with a known amount of liquid, provided the solid is not soluble in the liquid.

{{about|the [[planet]]|other uses|Venus (disambiguation)}}
'''Venus''' is the second [[planet]] from the [[Sun]].<ref>in our [[Solar System]]</ref> It is a ''[[terrestrial planet]]'' because it has a solid, [[Rock (geology)|rocky]] surface like other planets in the inner solar system. Astronomers have known Venus for thousands of years. The [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] named it after their [[god]]dess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]. Venus is the brightest thing in the night sky except for [[the Moon]]. It is sometimes called the ''morning star'' or the ''evening star'' as it is easily seen just before the sun comes up in the morning, and just after the sun goes down in the evening. Venus comes closer to the [[Earth]] than any other planet does.

Venus is sometimes called the [[sister]] planet of Earth as they are quite similar in size and [[gravity]]. In other ways the planets are very different. Venus' [[atmosphere]] (air) is mostly [[carbon dioxide]] with clouds of [[sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/venus/atmosphere.html|title=The Atmosphere of Venus}}</ref> Sulphuric acid is a [[chemical]] that is very [[poison]]ous to [[human]]s. 

The thick atmosphere has made it hard to see the surface, and until the twenty-first century many people thought things might [[life|live]] there. The [[pressure]] on Venus' surface is 92 times that of Earth. Venus has no [[Satellite (natural)|moons]].  Venus spins very slowly on its axis and it spins in the [[Retrograde and direct motion|opposite direction]] to the other planets.

== Physical Properties ==
[[File:Venus globe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Radar]] view of the surface of Venus ([[Magellan spacecraft]])]]
Venus is a terrestrial planet so, like the Earth, its surface is made of rock. Venus is much hotter than Earth. All the [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere acts like a [[blanket]], trapping heat from the Sun. This effect is called the [[greenhouse effect]] and it is very strong on Venus. This makes the surface of Venus the hottest of any planet's surface in the Solar System with an [[estimate]]d [[average]] [[temperature]] of {{convert|480|°C|°F|1}}.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://filer.case.edu/sjr16/advanced/venus.html|title=Venus - an overview}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2000/GeorgeRyabov.shtml|title=Temperature on the Surface of Venus}}</ref> This is hot enough to [[melting|melt]] [[lead]] or [[zinc]].

=== Geography ===
Venus has no oceans because it is much too hot for water. Venus' surface is a dry desert. Because of the clouds, only [[radar]] can map the surface. It is about 80% smooth, [[Rock (geology)|rocky]] [[plain]]s, made mostly of [[basalt]]. Two higher areas called [[continent]]s make up the north and south of the planet. The north is called ''Ishtar Terra'' and the south is called ''Aphrodite Terra''. They are named after the [[Babylon]]ian and [[Greek god]]desses of love.<ref>Batson R.M., Russell J.F. (1991), ''Naming the Newly Found Landforms on Venus'', Abstracts of the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, v. 22, p. 65</ref>

=== Atmosphere ===

Venus' [[atmosphere]] is mostly [[carbon dioxide]] and [[nitrogen]] [[gas]] with [[cloud]]s of [[sulphuric acid]]. Because the atmosphere is so thick or dense the [[pressure]] is very high. The pressure is 92 times the pressure on Earth, enough to crush many things.

It is impossible to see the planet's surface from [[Outer space|space]] as the thick [[cloud]] layer [[reflection|reflects]] 60% of the light that hits it. The only way scientists are able to see it is by using [[infrared]] and [[UV|ultraviolet]] [[camera]]s and [[radar]].

===Transit of Venus===
{{main|Transit of Venus}}

Venus can sometimes be seen passing between the sun and earth. Venus looks like a black dot when seen through a special telescope. These "transits" happen in pairs eight years apart. Then it's more than a hundred years to the next pair.

It was established on February 11, 1929, with the [[Lateran Agreement]] (''Patti Lateranensi''). This was signed by [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Pope Pius XI]]. The Vatican City is the [[headquarters]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and its government, the [[Holy See]].

The Head of State is the [[Pope]], now [[Pope Francis]], former [[cardinal]] Jorge Mario Bergoglio, was elected on 13 March 2013.
It is also important for its culture and art. The Vatican's masterpieces are very well known in the world: [[St. Peter's Square]], [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], the [[Vatican Museums]] and the [[Apostolic Palace]], where the [[Pope]] lives. There are also  hundreds of other  [[sculpture]]s and [[picture]]s.

== History ==

The Pope used to rule the Papal States, which included most of Italy. Catholic popes had generally tried to stop Italy from becoming one country because they feared they would lose their control of at least one of the Papal States.{{cn}} In 1861 Italy was unified under the King of Savoy, but [[Rome]] and [[Latium]] remained unconquered. On September 20, 1870 Italian troops invaded. Rome became capital of the new kingdom.

The [[Pope]] claimed he was a prisoner of the Italian state and [[excommunication|excommunicated]] all the people who helped invade the Papal state. This stopped Catholics from taking part in public life under Catholic government.

In 1929 [[Benito Mussolini]], decided to sign an agreement with the Holy See, called the [[Lateran Treaty]], which created the Vatican State. Another treaty gave the Vatican money each year to compensate for the lost territories.

== Politics and Government ==
The government [[Hierarchy|structure]] is a theocracy with the [[Pope|Pontifical leader]] being the highest authority. A bishop is elected by the College of Cardinals to become the new Pope and leader of the Holy See and the Romans Catholic Church. The Pope also holds the title of "Bishop of Rome".

== Religion ==
The religion of the city is the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

A change in velocity is called an [[acceleration]].

A '''virtual community''' is a [[community|group of people]] who share an interest, [[hobby]] or [[idea|set of views]]. The people in it may come from many different places. They talk with each other using [[technology]], such as the [[Internet]], [[telephone]] calls, and [[email]]. The most common is the Internet.

==How virtual communities communicate==

Virtual communities may use any of the following to communicate:

'''Internet'''
* [[Chat room]]s
* Email
* [[Instant messaging|Instant messenger]]s
* [[Forum]]s (''message boards'')
* [[Website]]s like [[social network service]]s
* [[Wiki]]

'''Telephone'''
* Conference calls (where more than 2 people can talk at one time)

'''[[Mail]]'''
* A [[newsletter]]
* A [[magazine]]

[[Category:Internet]]{{unsourced|date=February 2012}}
:''"The Web" redirects here. For other uses, see [[Web (disambiguation)]]''.

The '''World Wide Web''' ("'''WWW'''" or "'''The Web'''") is the part of the [[Internet]] that contains [[website]]s and [[webpage]]s. It was invented in 1989 by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]], [[Geneva City|Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. Sir Tim Berners-Lee created a new [[webpage]] called [[HTML]]. Websites are composed of pages linked by hypertext links. They are all written in the HTML page.

The World Wide Web is used to describe HTML webpages that are part of the Internet. 

In order to see the World Wide Web one needs a [[Tablet computer|computer]], and a modem. One also needs a connection to the [[Internet]].

Many companies nowadays offer limited [[Web hosting service|website hosting]] allowing one to make websites that can be displayed on the World Wide Web like any other [[Domain name|domain]] (www.stuff.com) site. These sites usually make money from [[advertisement]]s instead of [[fee]]s.

[[Category:Internet]]A '''wiki''' is a type of [[website]] that lets anyone who can access the wiki create and change its [[webpage|pages]]. The word is [[Internet slang]]. The word ''Wiki'' is short for WikiWikiWeb. ''Wikiwiki'' is a word from the [[Hawaiian language]], meaning "fast" or "[[speed]]".<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-09-19 | url=http://www.mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdshw.htm | title=Hawaiian Words; Hawaiian to English | publisher=mauimapp.com | work=Maui Island Guide | accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref> Examples of wikis include [[Wikipedia]], [[Citizendium]], and [[Conservapedia]].

Every wiki can be changed, or edited, by anyone who has an account on the wiki, or by everyone in the world if the wiki allows anonymous access, although some important pages cannot be changed by anyone. Wikis are central places where we all can share information with each other, people can add new information, and then people read them. Wikis allow information from all around the world to be collected.

On a wiki, people can write pages together to add to the information.  Pages are watched closely to see whether changes are good or bad.  If one person writes something wrong, then the next person can correct it. The next person can also add something new to the page.  Because of this, the page gets better when people change it.  Administrators can block someone from editing if they vandalise, or for other reasons.   

Users can also discuss things on wikis. [[Discussion]] can help people understand things better, or gives people a chance to tell their views. In Wikipedia the talk pages are for that, but in some wikis, the article and the discussion are in the same page.

Wikis can be used for different things; not all wikis follow the same rules for using them.  For example, the purpose of Wikipedia is to write [[article]]s for an [[encyclopedia]].  That is why in Wikipedia, people do not want general discussion that does not help in writing articles.

[[Ward Cunningham]] started the first wiki in March 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiWeb |title=Wiki Wiki Web |first= |last= |work=c2.com |year=2011 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.re-public.gr/en/?p=141 |title=Wiki and the rise of gift economies|first=Ward |last=Cunningham |work=Re-imagining democracy |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts, and Other Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms|last=Richardson|first=Bill|publisher=Corwin Press|date=2008|page=p.60|isbn=1412959713}}</ref> Many people liked it and wrote there, after which they started similar websites.  Wiki is also sometimes an abbreviation for Wikipedia.

== Vandalism ==
A wiki is freely editable by anyone. Some wikis are even available to people without an account, so wikis are targets for vandals to add bad content to because it is easy. There are many ways to prevent this. Individual pages can be protected to allow only certain users, or only those with an account, to edit them. Administrators can also block users who make much trouble. Vandalism may not be stopped totally, but regular, careful checking can diminish the amount. 

== Types of wiki software ==
* [[MediaWiki]]
* [[Dokuwiki]]
* [[Phpwiki]]
* [[Pmwiki]]
* [[Tikiwiki]]
* [[Wikkawiki]]
* [[JSPWiki]]

A '''website''' is a set of [[webpage]]s that are joined together. People look at websites with a [[computer]] of some kind, sometimes including the computer inside [[mobile telephone]]s and [[television]]s. The websites are kept on computers called [[server|web servers]].


There is almost always a single [[homepage]] which has [[link]]s to other pages that are part of that "site". Sometimes it has links to pages that are part of other "sites" as well. (Note that [[net jargon]] uses the word [[site]], which also means a physical place in the real world, to mean a [[World Wide Web|web]] [[URL]]). A home page serves as the [[wikt:introduction|introduction]] page of a website.
 
Websites can be used to [[advertise]] or sell things. They can also be used to talk to other people. A [[blog]] is a website where the location of the material is less relevant than who writes it, and which is more focused on dialogue. Very often the people who use blogs dislike the word "site" since it implies a controlled place. Sites are good for looking up [[information]] on the computer.

== Types of websites ==
* [[Weblog]] ''(or also known as blog)''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/w/weblog.htm |title=Weblog |author= |date= |website= |publisher=Computer Hope |accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref>

* [[Content Management System]] ''(A piece of internet software that can edit web pages through a [[WYSIWYG]] editor)''.
* [[Search engine]] ''(A website like [[Google]], which you can use to search the web)''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/0/22562913 |title=What is a search engine? |author= |date=6 June 2013 |website= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=3 April 2016}}</ref>

== Access ==
Users can access any website by using a [[URL]]. This is the website address which is shown near the top of the web browser. The homepage and the rest of the site usually have the same words at the start of the URL — for instance, pages at the Simple English Wikipedia always start "http://simple.wikipedia.org/..." but are different after that. However if a person does not buy a [[domain name]] the website could be an [[IP Address]] which for example could be (127.0.0.1)

== Appearance ==
Web sites are usually shown in [[HTML]] (Hyper Text Markup Language) but are not always written or kept that way - some use [[WAP]] and others use [[XML]].

== Website builder software ==
This is usually a collection of software tools that allow the construction of websites without manual code editing.<ref name=Peri251>Peri Pakroo; Marcia Stewart, ''Small Business Start-Up Kit, The: A Step-by-Step Legal Guide'' (Berkeley, CA: Nolo, 2014), p. 251</ref> Several hosted website services have website builder software built-in.<ref name=Peri251/>

[[Category:Websites| ]]{{for|the popular word processor made by Microsoft|Microsoft Word}}
A '''word''' is something spoken by the [[mouth]], that can be pronounced. It is also a collection of [[letter]]s used together to try to communicate a meaning, and these can also usually be pronounced. A [[logogram]] is also a word. 

Some words have more than one [[meaning]], for example 'spring' can refer to the season, the [[Spring (device)|device]], or a [[conjugation]] of the verb. Some words have different [[pronunciation]], for example, 'wind' (the noun) and 'wind' (the verb) are pronounced differently. Some words have different [[spelling]] for example 'color' and 'colour', which are both correct. Color is used in [[American English]] and colour is used in [[British English]]. Some words can be only one letter, for example "a" and "I" in [[English language|English]]. Besides English, other [[language]]s have their own words.

For example, ''[[hello]]'' is a word.

== Fuller definition ==
A word is the smallest thing which can be said ''with meaning''. This contrasts with a [[morpheme]], which is the smallest unit of meaning but may not stand on its own. A word may consist of a single morpheme (for example: ''oh!, rock, red, quick, run, expect''), or several (''rocks, redness, quickly, running, unexpected''), whereas a morpheme may not be able to stand on its own as a word (in the words just given, these are ''-s, -ness, -ly, -ing, un-, -ed'').

The meaning of a word can be found in a [[dictionary]].

[[Category:Basic English 850 words]]A '''web browser''' is a [[computer program]] application found on all modern computers.  They are also now a common feature of mobile phones or other [[mobile_device |mobile devices]] and [[tablet computer | tablet computers]] like the [[iPad]] or [[Android (operating system) | Android]] tablets.

Web browsers are used by people to find and look at [[web site]]s on the [[Internet]].  The first web browser was created in 1990.  Many different web browsers are available for free.  All web browsers can go to websites but each browser has good things and bad things about it.  For example, some browsers focus on [[Information security|data security]] and keeping computers safe from [[computer virus|viruses]].  Other browsers are made so that web pages appear on screen faster.

Some popular web browsers available to download:
[[File:Wikipedia page by Flock browser.jpg|thumb|305px|Print-Screen of a [[Simple Wikipedia]] page by [[Flock|Flock browser]].]]
* [[Internet Explorer]]
* [[Google Chrome]]
* [[Mozilla Firefox]]

* [[Maxthon]]
* [[Epiphany (software)|Epiphany]]
* [[Galeon]]
* [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]]
* [[Sleipnir (web browser)|Sleipnir]]

== Web browsers and HTML ==
A web page is one page of a [[website]].  Every web page has a [[Uniform Resource Locator|web address]].

Web pages are mostly [[text]] (words), [[image|images]] and [[hyperlink|links]] to other web pages.

Most web pages are in the [[HTML]] (HyperText Markup Language) format.  HTML files contain computer language about how the text, pictures and links on a web page should look.

A web browser goes to a web page using a web address.  It downloads the HTML file stored at that address. It then reads and translates the HTML file.  The browser will then show the webpage on the screen as text, [[image]]s and clickable links.

{{disambig}}A '''webpage''' is part of a [[website]]. It is in the form of text and images. Web pages are connected by [[link]]s. [[Click]]ing on a link makes another webpage appear. Webpages are hosted on [[server|web servers]] and [[download]]ed and viewed with a [[web browser]]. Web pages are sent to the browser in [[HTML]] code. The writer of the page can write HTML directly, or use a computer program to convert other writing to HTML. 

For example, each Wikipedia article, like this one, is a page of the large [[Wikipedia]] web site.

'''Wiktionary''' is a [[dictionary]], or a group of meanings for words, in the form of a [[wiki]]. There are many [[languages]] of Wiktionary. Wiktionary is also a [[thesaurus]]. Wiktionary is run by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], which also runs [[Wikipedia]]. There is a [[Wikipedia:Simple English Wiktionary|Simple English Wiktionary]], which is the sister project to the [[Simple English Wikipedia]]. The Simple [[English language|English]] Wiktionary was created on November 2005. As of June 2016, it has over 24,000 articles (or entries), over 16,000 users and 4 administrators.<ref>[http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:Statistics Special:Statistics - Wiktionary] - Retrieved on May 10, 2015.</ref>

==Logo==
In 2006, there was a vote for the change of the logo of Wiktionary. The original logo of only words was replaced. However, there were very few people who voted in this contest. Therefore, smaller wikis used the newer logo but the [[English language|English]] Wiktionary stayed the same logo.

In 2009, there was a second contest for a newer logo ''(pictured)''. This was a step to make all the [[Wiktionaries]] to have the same logo on all projects. However, the English Wiktionary still did not use the new [[logo]]. The Simple English Wiktionary voted on the new logo on November 30, 2010 and the community decided the new logo to become their logo.<ref>[http://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Simple_talk/Archive_15#New_Wiktionary_logo New Wiktionary Logo vote - Simple English Wiktionary] - Retrieved April 20, 2011</ref> However, no changes were made to the logo and the discussion was thus forgotten.

'''Microsoft Windows''' is an [[operating system]] for [[computer]]s which is made by [[Microsoft]], a company from the [[United States]].  Almost 90% of [[desktop]] and [[laptop]] computers use Windows.

== History ==
The first version of Windows came out on November 20, 1985 and was called [[Windows 1.0]]. Since then, new versions of Windows go on sale every three years. The newest version, [[Windows 10]], came out July 29, 2015. Most newly bought [[personal computer]]s come with Windows 10, although some older or cheaper ones may have older versions such as [[Windows 8.1]] or [[Windows 7]] installed. Until July 29, 2016, they can be upgraded to Windows 10 for free.

Windows makes it easier to run [[computer software|programs]] (applications) than [[MS-DOS]] did. To use [[DOS]], you [[typing|typed]] a [[Command Line Interface|commands]] to make the computer do something. You had to use the correct [[syntax]] of each command. If you made a mistake, the computer usually gave an [[error]] message and did nothing.

== Design ==
Windows makes it easier to do things because of its [[Graphical user interfaces and consoles|graphical user interface]] (or GUI for short).  It only needs a keyboard ''or'' a [[Computer mouse|mouse]] to work. However, using both a keyboard and a mouse makes it easier to use Windows. By clicking a few [[Button (control)|buttons]] on the screen, Windows helps keep your files safe, and easier to change and move. The latest versions of Windows also work with [[touch screen]]s, making it even easier to use for [[accessibility|users with disabilities]]. Because of this, Windows even comes with some [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s.  [[Mobile device]]s that use Windows include [[Microsoft Surface]] and [[Microsoft Lumia]].

== Programs ==
Some programs are included with Windows. Some examples are:

* [[WordPad]] – to write simple documents, typically using words/text.
* Windows Photo Viewer – to look at pictures.
* [[Microsoft Paint]] – to make simple drawings or change pictures.
* [[Microsoft Edge]] web browser – to use the [[Internet]] to look at [[World Wide Web|web]] pages and [[download]] files.
* Windows DVD Player to watch videos. 
* Windows Groove to play and listen to music 

Many kinds of applications/programs are available for Windows.  Some popular applications are [[video games|games]], [[word processor]]s (to write words) or additional programs like [[Adobe Flash Player]] (to watch some videos and play many games on internet sites).  Adding new applications to Windows is called "installing".  Applications can be bought/purchased on a CD or [[DVD]].  Applications can also be downloaded from the Internet, some for free, and others you can [[Online shopping|buy using the internet]].

== Criticism ==
Many users complain that Windows creates problems for them. Some people say that their computers become slower/less fast because of Windows. Many people also complain about problems that make their computer less safe to use, even though Microsoft tries to fix these problems. Because Windows was until recently the most popular operating system (today mobile operating systems such as Android are more popular), most [[computer virus]]es are created to infect computers running Windows. {{fact|date=February 2015}}

{{about|the architectural element|the computing term|Window (computing)|the operating system|Microsoft Windows}}
A '''window''' is an opening in a [[wall]] or roof of a [[building]], in a [[car]] etc., to let [[air]] and [[light]] in. It is usually filled with a sheet of [[glass]]. There can be many different shapes and sizes, including [[rectangle|rectangular]], [[square (geometry)|square]], [[circle|circular]], or irregular [[shape]]s. Some windows include [[stained glass|coloured glass]]. Windows are usually [[transparency|transparent]] so that people can see through them.

Before glass was used in windows, people in Asia used paper to fill the hole in the wall. The paper would let light in.

'''Wine''' is an [[alcohol]]ic [[drink]]. The word ''wine'' is usually used to talk about drinks made from the [[juice]] of [[grape]]s, although people sometimes call alcoholic drinks made from the juice of other [[fruit]]s (such as [[plums]] or [[blackberries]]) "wine". This article only deals with wine made from grapes.

Wine is made by the [[fermentation]] of the sugar in grapes. There are two main types of wine, '''red wine''' and '''white wine'''.  Red wine is made from red grapes, and white wine is made from white grapes. Rosé wine is made by leaving red grapes in skin contact for a very short time. The colour comes only from the skin, so if you have short skin contact, the wine will not turn red but only "pink" ([[rose wine]]).  Wine sometimes has bubbles in it; this wine is called [[sparkling wine]]. The most popular sparkling wine is [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]], which comes from [[France]].

People have been making wine for about 5000 years. 

Wine is a popular drink in many countries. The countries that drink the most wine (using numbers from the year [[2000]]) are: 

# [[France]]
# [[Italy]]
# [[United States|USA]]
# [[Germany]]
# [[Spain]]
# [[Argentina]]
# [[United Kingdom]]
# [[China]]
# [[Russia]]
# [[Romania]].

However, if you make a list of countries where the average person drinks the most wine, the list is different:

[[Luxembourg]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Croatia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Spain]], [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Slovenia]].

Wine is made in many countries. The countries that make the most wine (using [[2000]] numbers) are: 

[[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[United States|USA]], [[Argentina]], [[Germany]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], [[Portugal]], and [[Chile]].

== Uses of water ==
[[Plant]]s and [[animal]]s (including [[wikt:people|people]]) are mostly water inside, and must drink water to live. It gives a [[Media|medium]] for [[chemical reaction]]s to take place, and is the main part of [[blood plasma|blood]]. It keeps the body [[temperature]] the same by [[sweat]]ing from the [[skin]].  Water helps blood carry [[nutrient]]s from the [[stomach]] to all parts of the body to keep the body alive.  Water also helps the blood carry [[oxygen]] from the [[lung]]s to the body.  [[Saliva]], which helps animals and people digest food, is mostly water. Water helps make [[urine]]. Urine helps remove bad [[chemical]]s from the body. The human body is between 60% and 70% water.

Water is the main component of [[drink]]s like [[milk]], [[juice]], and [[wine]]. Each type of drink also has other things that add [[flavor]] or [[nutrient]]s, things like [[sugar]], [[fruit]], and sometimes [[alcohol]]. Water that a person can drink is called "potable water" (or "drinking water".)  The water in oceans is [[salt water]], but lakes and rivers usually have [[fresh water|unsalted water]]. Only about 3% of all the water on earth is fresh water. The rest is salt water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html|title=Percentage of water}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdli.ca/CITE/water.htm|title=Fresh water percentage (2)}}</ref>

Many places, including cities and [[desert]]s, don't have as much water as people want. They build [[aqueduct]]s to bring water there.
Water is Containable And actually tasty (I think)But yea Hi

==What water is made of==

Water is a [[molecule]] made of 2 [[hydrogen]] [[atom]]s and 1 [[oxygen]] atom. Its [[chemical formula]] is H<sub>2</sub>O.
Water has a [[surface tension]], so a little water can make drops on a surface, rather than always spreading out to wet the surface.
Water can also be called 'aqua', which is the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] word for water.
Water is also used for recreational purposes. Though a human being can survive for up to a three weeks without food, they can only survive for a day or two without water. A few [[desert]] animals can get enough water from their food, but the others must drink.

[[Image:A Christmas Carol - Ignorance and Want.jpg|thumb|Want and Ignorance -two poor children in Dickens' novel]]
A '''want''' is a [[wish]] or a [[wikt:desire|desire]] for something. If a person would like to have something, but can choose not to have it, that thing is wanted or can be called a want. To want is not the same as to [[need]], which is when someone ''must'' have something.

People often talk about needing a thing, when they really just want it. Wants can be for the same things as needs. For example, a person can ''need'' to eat food and can ''want'' to eat cake. If there is no cake then he or she may have to eat something else, perhaps bread. The need is no longer so important (the person is no longer [[hungry]]) although the want may still be there. If there is cake, then the person's needs and wants can both be met.

In [[economics]], a want is about [[Product (consumer goods)|goods]] or [[service economy|service]]s. [[Choice]] is how to [[satisfaction|satisfy]] a want, when there are different ways to do this.

Want can also be the idea of what it means to be [[Poverty|poor]], [[Starvation|hungry]] or with no [[money]]. [[Charles Dickens]] wrote a famous book called ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' in which there are two children, named Want and [[Ignorance]].

== Kinds of war ==
Sometimes, people don't see a difference between fighting between countries or people, and the [[declaration of war|formal declaration]] of a '''state of war.''' Those who do see this difference usually only use the word "war" for the fighting where the countries' [[government]]s have officially declared war on each other. Smaller armed conflicts are often called [[riot]]s, rebellions, [[coup d'etat|coups]], etc. 

One country may send forces to another country for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it is to help keep order or prevent [[genocide|killings of innocents]] or other [[crimes against humanity]]. It may be to protect a friendly government against an uprising. Here it may be called a [[police action]] or [[humanitarian intervention]] instead of a war. Some people think it's still a war.

Another kind of war existed from 1947 until 1991 called the [[Cold War]].<ref name=coldwarHIST>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/topics/cold-war/cold-war-history |title=Cold War History |author= |date= |website=History |publisher=A&E Television Networks, LLC |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref> This started when [[diplomatic relations]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] broke down.<ref name=coldwarHIST/> Both countries had [[nuclear weapons]] and both stood ready to use them against the other.<ref name=coldwarHIST/> But there was no actual war between the two. It ended with the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.<ref name=coldwarHIST/> The cold war was also called a [[containment]] where the United States tried to prevent the spread of [[communism]] to other countries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/cold-war-containment.htm |title=Cold War - Containment |author= |date= |website= |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref> During the cold war, the major powers did not fight themselves, but often backed third parties in what was called a [[proxy war]].<ref name=proxywarVW>{{cite web |url=http://thevietnamwar.info/proxy-war/ |title=What is a Proxy War? |author= |date= |website= |publisher=The Vietnam War |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref> The [[Vietnam War]] is often given as an [[example]] of a proxy war.<ref name=proxywarVW/> But proxy wars happened long before the cold war and are still happening.<ref name=proxywarVW/>

A war between peoples and groups in the same country is known as a [[civil war]].<ref name=WongNYT>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/world/middleeast/26war.html?_r=0 |title=A Matter of Definition: What Makes a Civil War, and Who Declares It So? |author=Edward Wong |date=26 November 2006 |website= |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref> It is generally agreed there are two things that make a war a civil war.<ref name=WongNYT/> It must be a struggle between groups in the same country or [[state]] over political control or to force a major change in the government's [[wikt:policy|policy]].<ref name=WongNYT/> The second [[wikt:criterion|criterion]] is that more than 1000 people have to have been killed, with a minimum of 100 from each side.<ref name=WongNYT/> The [[American Civil War]] is an example of a civil war. While the figures are mere estimates, the total [[American Civil War casualties|casualties]] are thought to be about 750,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://discovere.binghamton.edu/news/civilwar-3826.html |title=Historian revises estimate of Civil War dead |author=Rachel Coker |date=21 September 2011 |website=Discover-e |publisher=Binghamton University, The State University of New York |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref>

'''Yiddish''' is a [[language]] used by some [[Jew]]s. At first it was a [[dialect]] of the [[German language]] which Jews began to use in [[Europe]] about a thousand years ago. It was (and is) used in the [[United States]], especially in [[New York]], and other countries where Jews have migrated to. Most of its words are of [[German language|German]] origin. Also, Yiddish has many words from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Slav]]ic languages, notably [[Polish language|Polish]]. It also contains some French, Hungarian, and Latin words. Yiddish is usually written in Hebrew characters.

In the whole world, Yiddish is spoken by about 3 million people. It is mainly spoken by [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews.]]

== European Charter ==
In the [[Netherlands]] and [[Sweden]], Yiddish is protected by the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].

One '''year''' is about 365 [[day]]s long (except in a [[leap year]]). It is the time it takes the [[Earth]] to go completely around ([[orbit]]) the [[sun]] once. A year is actually 365¼ days long, but a [[calendar]] has 365 days, except in a leap year.

The year starts on January 1 and ends on December 31 in the [[Gregorian calendar]], but a [[fiscal year]] or a [[school year]] can start on a different day of the year.

There are several ways used to measure the length of a year.

* a '''solar''' year is based on the [[season]]s. The Gregorian calendar is based on the solar year.  The solar year is 365 days long.
* a '''lunar''' year is based on the [[moon]] and is usually 12 [[lunar month]]s (29 days, 12 [[hour]]s, 44 [[minute]]s each) or 354 days long.
* a '''tropical''' year is the time between two [[equinox|vernal equinoxes]], the first day of spring when the lengths of daylight and night are the same.
* a '''sidereal''' year measures the time between when a selected [[star|fixed star]] is highest in the [[wikt:night|night]] [[sky]].
* an '''anomalistic year''' is the difference between the times when the Earth gets closest to the sun.
* an '''eclipse''' year is the time between node passages. This is when the sun moves through a part of the sky where it is possible for the sun, Earth and moon to be in a line. It is also when [[solar eclipse]]s can happen.

Solar and lunar years are used by different [[society|societies]] in daily life. The other measurements are used by [[astronomer]]s.

* there was no year numbered "year zero" in a normal system of counting, because it would mean there is a year earlier than the first year, which was the year [[1|AD one]] in the [[Anno Domini]] system, also called 1 CE in the [[Common Era]], used with our [[Gregorian calendar]]. However, some astronomers call the year 1 BC (or BCE) "year 0" to make it easier for them to count leap years before that year.

'''You''' is a [[grammatical person|second-person]] [[English language|English]] [[pronoun]]. The word can be [[singular]] or [[plural]]. It is what a person says when he or she is addressing another person in second person. Sometimes, just using the [[English language|English]] letter "[[u]]" is acceptable, and "ur" for the words "you're" and "your". This is very informal, and is mostly used in [[texting]].

A '''[[yard]]''' is a unit of length in some measuring systems.

'''Yard''' can also mean:
*[[Yard (land)]], an open space around a building. For instance, the space around a school is called a ''school yard''. A yard is used by humans and their pets.  If there is wild space next to it, like forest land, swamp land, a beach or a lake, this will not normally be considered "part of" the yard – the yard ends at the edge of it.
*[[Yard (sailing)]], a spar on a traditional sailing ship
*[[Brickyard]], a place where bricks are made or stored

The '''Chinese language''' is the group of languages used by Chinese in [[China]] and elsewhere. It forms part of a language family called the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan family of languages]]. 

Chinese includes many regional language varieties, the main ones being [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Yue Chinese|Yue]], and [[Min Chinese|Min]]. These are not [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]],<ref>This means a speaker from one region cannot understand a speaker from another region, unless they have also learnt that language.</ref> and many of the regional varieties (especially [[Min Chinese|Min]]) are themselves a number of non-mutually-intelligible subvarieties. Jerry Norman estimated that there are hundreds of mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese.<ref>Norman J. 2003. The Chinese dialects: phonology. In Thurgood, Graham & LaPolla, Randy J. (eds) ''The Sino-Tibetan languages''. Routledge, pp. 72–83. ISBN 978-0-7007-1129-1</ref> As a result, many linguists refer to these varieties as separate languages.<ref>DeFrancis, John 1984. The Chinese language: fact and fantasy. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press. ISBN 978-0-8248-1068-9</ref> 

'Chinese' can refer to the written or the spoken languages. Although there are many spoken Chinese languages, they use only one writing system for the language.<ref>As do European languages, which all use an alphabetic script.</ref> Differences in speaking are reflected in differences in writing. Official China adopts a similar policy to the one in the [[Soviet Union]]. All official documents are written in [[Mandarin]], and Mandarin is taught all over China. They have one standard language for all of the schools in China and [[Taiwan]]. It is also a standard for language teaching in some other countries. In English we call it [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]]. In China they call it "''Pǔtōnghuà''" or "common to everybody speech." In Taiwan they call it "''Guóyǔ''" or "language of the whole country". They need a standard language because otherwise many people would not understand each other, despite being in the same country .

Chinese is used by the [[Han people]] in China and other ethnic groups who have come into China and are declared Chinese by the Chinese government. Chinese is almost always written in [[Chinese character]]s. They are symbols that have meaning, called [[logogram]]s. They also give '''some''' indication of pronunciation. But just as "Xavier" sounds very different in English (ex-aye-vee-er), French (za-vee-aye), and Spanish (hah-veer), the same character can get very different pronunciations among the different kinds of Chinese. Since Chinese characters have been around for at least 3500 years, it is no wonder that people in places far from each other would say them differently, just as "1, 2, 3" can be read differently in different languages.

Chinese people needed to write down pronunciations in dictionaries. Chinese does not have an alphabet, so how to write down sounds was a big problem in the beginning. Nowadays the Mandarin language uses [[Hanyu Pinyin|Hanyu pinyin]] to represent the sounds in [[Roman letter]]s.

All the Chinese languages (or [[dialect]]s) use [[tonal language|tones]]. This means that they use high and low pitches to help make differences in meaning clear.

== Different languages or dialects of Chinese ==
The Chinese language is like a big tree. The base of the tree started thousands of years ago. It now has several main limbs. Some people call "just a branch" what other people call a main limb, so you can say there are six or seven main limbs. Each of these main limbs splits off into branches about the way there are branches of English spoken in Great Britain, the United States, Australia, India, and so forth. Line the Chinese limbs up by number of speakers and we get: Mandarin, the language spoken in an area centering on Shanghai, the language spoken in Guangdong province (Cantonese), the language spoken mostly in Fujian province (but also by many speakers in Taiwan), the language spoken mostly in Hunan province, a language that is historically that of a refugee group and so not so closely concentrated in any one area in south-east China (it is called "Hakka" or "guest family" speech), and a language spoken in an area that centers on Jiangxi province. Just as the [[Romance languages]] all come from the area around Rome and are based on Latin, the Chinese languages all have some common source, so they keep many common things among them.

[[File:Origin of Chinese Languages rev.svg|350px|thumb|Branches in modern times are only shown for "Guan" (Language of the officials. Mandarin).]]
Here are the main seven main groups of languages/dialects of Chinese by size:

* Guan ("Northern" or Mandarin) 北方話/北方话 or 官話/官话, (about 850 million speakers)， 
* Wu 吳/吴, which includes Shanghainese, (about 90 million speakers)， 
* Yue ([[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]) 粵/粤, (about 80 million speakers)， 
* Min ([[Hokkien]], which includes Taiwanese) 閩/闽, (about 50 million speakers), 
* Xiang 湘, (about 35 million speakers), 
* [[Hakka (language)|Hakka]] 客家 or 客, (about 35 million speakers)， 
* Gan 贛/赣, (about 20 million speakers)

== Traditional and simplified characters ==

In 1956, the government of the People's Republic of China made public a set of [[simplified Chinese characters]] to make learning, reading and writing the Chinese language easier. In Mainland China and [[Singapore]], people use these simpler characters. In [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], and other places where they speak Chinese, people still use the more [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional characters]]. The [[Korean language]] also uses Chinese characters to represent certain words. The [[Japanese language]] uses them even more often. These characters are known in Korean as [[Hanja]] and in Japanese as [[Kanji]]. 

A Chinese person with a good education today knows 6,000-7,000 characters. About 3,000 Chinese characters are needed to read a Mainland newspaper. However, people who have learned only the 400 most frequently used characters can read a newspaper—but they will have to guess some less-used words.

== Examples ==

Here are some samples of some words and sentences in [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Simplified Characters are on the left, and Traditional characters are on the right. The pronunciation is given in the [[pinyin]] system, which may not always be as simple as it looks for those who have not studied it.

The Traditional Characters are now used in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Chinese from Mainland China uses the Simplified Characters, but may recognize Traditional Characters.

Before 1956, Chinese was written using only Traditional Characters. At that time most Chinese people could not read or write at all. The government of the People's Republic of China thought that the Traditional characters were very hard to understand. They also thought that if they made the characters simpler more people could learn how to read and write. Today, many people in China can read and write with the new Simplified Characters.

* Adding a number to zero results in that number. For example, adding zero to three gives three. In [[symbols]]:
 3 + 0 = 3
* Subtracting zero from a number always gives that number. For example, subtracting zero from three gives three. In symbols:
 3 − 0 = 3
* Subtracting a positive number from zero always makes that number [[negative]] (or, if a negative number is subtracted from zero, it makes the number positive). In symbols:
 0 − 3 = −3
* Multiplying a number by zero always gives zero. For example, multiplying forty-three by zero gives zero. In symbols:
 43 &times; 0 = 0

* Dividing zero by a number always gives zero. For example, dividing zero by forty-three gives zero. In symbols:

 43 ÷ 0 has an undefined answer.
* Zero divided by zero has no answer. In symbols:
 0 ÷ 0 has no answer.

== History of zero ==
The idea of zero was first thought about in [[Babylon]], [[India]] and in [[Central America]] at different times. Some places and countries did not know about a zero, which may have made it harder for those people to do [[mathematics]]. 

Over hundreds of years the idea of zero was passed from country to country. From [[India]] and [[Babylon]] to other places, like [[Greece]], [[Persia]] and the [[Arab]] parts of the world. The [[Europe]]ans learned about zero from the [[Arab]]s.

== The place of zero as a number ==
Zero is almost never used as a place number ([[ordinal number]]). This means that it is not used like 1, 2, or 3 to indicate the order, or place, of something, like 1st, 2nd, or 3rd. An exception to this is seen in many programming languages.

Some other things about zero:
* The number zero is a [[whole number]].
* The number zero is not a [[positive number]].
* The number zero is not a [[negative number]], either.
* The number zero is a [[neutral number]].

Any number [[Division (mathematics)|divided]] by itself equals one, except if that number is zero. In symbols:

0 ÷ 0 = "[[Division by zero|not a number.]]"

In [[time]], zero means "[[now]]". For example, when a person is [[counting]] down the time to the start of something, such as a foot race or when a [[rocket]] takes off, the count is: "three, two, one, zero (or ''go'')". Zero is the exact time of the start of the race or when the [[rocket]] takes off into the sky.

==  0 as a number ==
0 is the [[integer]] that precedes the positive [[1 (number)|1]], and follows [[-1 (number)|−1]]. In most (if not all) numerical systems, 0 was identified before the idea of 'negative integers' was accepted. It means "courageous one" in [[hieroglyphics]].

Zero is a number which means an amount of [[null]] size; that is, if the number of your brothers is zero, that means the same thing as having no brothers, and if something has a weight of zero, it has no weight. If the difference between the numbers of pieces in two piles is zero, it means the two piles have an equal number of pieces. Before counting starts, the result can be assumed to be zero; that is the number of items counted before you count the first item and counting the first item brings the result to one. And if there are no items to be counted, zero remains the final result.

While mathematicians all accept zero as a number, some non-mathematicians would say that zero is not a number, arguing that one cannot have zero of something. Others say that if one has a bank balance of zero, one has a specific quantity of money in that account, namely none. It is that latter view which is accepted by mathematicians and most others.

Normally speaking, there was no year zero between 1 BC and 1 AD. More exactly, almost all [[historian]]s leave out the [[year zero]] from the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar|proleptic Gregorian]] and [[proleptic Julian calendar|Julian calendars]] (that is, from the normal calendar used in English-speaking countries), but [[astronomer]]s include it in these same calendars. However, the phrase [[Year Zero (political notion)|Year Zero]] may be used to describe any event considered so important, that someone might want to start counting years all over again from zero.

== 0 as a numeral ==
[[File:Text figures 036.svg|71px|right]]
The modern numeral 0 is normally written as a circle or (rounded) rectangle. In old-style fonts with [[text figures]], 0 is usually the same height as a lowercase x.

{| style="clear: right" align="right"
| [[File:7-segment cdeg.svg|right|80px|Unusual appearance of the digit zero on seven-segment displays]] 
| [[File:7-segment abcdef.svg|right|80px|Usual appearance of the digit zero on seven-segment displays]]
|}
On the [[seven-segment display]]s of calculators, watches, etc., 0 is usually written with six line segments, though on some historical calculator models it was written with four line segments. The four-segment 0 is not common.

The ''number'' zero (as in the "zero brothers" example above) is not the same as the ''numeral'' or ''digit'' zero, used in [[numeral system]]s using [[positional notation]]. Successive positions of digits have higher values, so the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate value to the preceding and following digits. A zero digit is not always necessary in a different positional number system. Something called [[bijective numeration]] is a possible example of a system without zeroes.

== The numerical digit zero ==
'''0''' ('''zero''') is also used as a [[numerical digit]] used to represent that number in [[numeral]]s. It is used to hold the place of that digit, because correct placing of digits affects a numeral's value.

Examples:
* In the numeral 10, which stands for one times ten and zero units (or ones).
* In the numeral 100, which stands for one times a hundred plus zero tens plus zero units.

== Telling zero and the letter O apart ==

[[File:Zero o comparison.svg|right|A comparison of the letter O and the number 0]]
The number 0 and the letter O are both round, so what is the difference? The difference is important on a computer. For one thing, a computer will not do arithmetic with the letter O, because it does not know that it should have been a zero.

The oval-shaped zero and circular letter [[O]] came into use together on modern character displays. The zero with a dot in the centre seems to have begun as a choice on IBM 3270 controllers (this has the problem that it looks like the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[Theta (letter)|theta]]). The slashed zero, looking like the letter O with a diagonal line drawn inside it, is used in old-style ASCII graphic sets that came from the default typewheel on the well-known ASR-33 Teletype. This format causes problems because it looks like the symbol <math>\\emptyset</math>, representing the [[empty set]], as well as for certain Scandinavian languages which use Ø as a letter.
 
The rule which has the letter O with a slash and the zero without was used at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers; this is even more of a problem for [[Scandinavia]]ns because it looks like two of their letters at the same time. Some Burroughs/Unisys computers display a zero with a backwards slash. And yet another convention common on early line [[computer printer|printers]] left zero without any extra dots or slashes but added a tail or hook to the letter O so that it resembled an inverted [[Q]] or cursive capital letter O.

[[File:Deutsches Kfz-Kennzeichen für Behördenfahrzeuge (Nummernbereich 3).jpg|thumbnail|right|A German licence plate showing zeroes]]
The letters used on some European number plates for [[automobile|cars]] make the two symbols look different. This is done by making the zero rather egg-shaped and the O more circular, but most of all by cutting open the zero on the upper right side, so the circle is not closed any more (as in [[:Image:Deutsches Kfz-Kennzeichen für Behördenfahrzeuge (Nummernbereich 3).jpg|German plates]]). The style of letters chosen is called ''[[:Image:FE-Schrift.svg|fälschungserschwerende Schrift]]'' (abbr.: ''FE Schrift''), meaning "script which is harder to falsify". But those used in the [[United Kingdom]] do not make the letter o and the number 0 look different from each other, because there can never be any mistake if the letters are correctly spaced.

In paper writing you do not have to make the 0 and O look different at all. Or you may add a slash across the zero in order to show the difference, although this sometimes causes mistakes in the number 0.

==Zeroes of a function== <!-- [[Zeroes of a function]] and [[Zeros of a function]] redirect here -->
Functions are explained in the [[Function (mathematics)]] article. If the function ''f''(''x'') = 0, then ''x'' is called a zero of the function ''f''. For example, if the function ''f''(''x'') is ''x''<sup>2</sup> − 1, then the zeroes of the function are +1 and −1, because ''f''(+1) = (+1)<sup>2</sup> − 1 = 0, and ''f''(−1) = (−1)<sup>2</sup> − 1 = 0.

Zeroes of a function are used because they are another way to talk about solving an [[equation]], which is a main goal in [[algebra]]. If we want to solve an equation like ''x''<sup>2</sup> = 1, then we can subtract the right-hand side of the equation from both sides, in this case 1. Whatever we get on the left-hand side, in this case ''x''<sup>2</sup> − 1, can be called a function  ''f''(x). The right-hand side has to be zero, because we subtracted it from itself. So ''f''(x) = 0. Finding the zeroes of this function is the same as solving this equation. In the paragraph before, the zeroes of this function are +1 and −1, so they are the solutions of this equation. We got this equation by subtracting the same thing from both sides, so we also have solutions to the equation we started with, in this case ''x''<sup>2</sup> = 1. So if we could find zeroes of functions, we could solve any equation.

[[Category:Integers]]'''Zoology''' is the [[science]]  of studying [[animal]] life. It is part of [[biology]]. The word is pronounced ''Zō-ölogy'', not ''Zoo-ology''. Animal life is classified into groups called [[phyla]], of which there are at least 30. 

'''Zoologists''' are scientists who study animals. They may work in [[laboratory|laboratories]], or do [[field research]]. The methods are many and various. At the heart, they cover the [[structure]], [[function]], [[ecology]] and [[evolution]] of animals. The structure is investigated by [[dissection]], and [[microscopic]] examination. The function is investigated by [[observation]] and [[experiment]]. [[Palaeontology]] supplies information about [[extinct]] animals. Zoologists may be employed by [[universities]], [[museum]]s, or by [[zoo]]s.

'''Zinc''', sometimes called '''spelter''',<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.encyclo.co.uk/define/spelter|title=Spelter|publisher=Encyclo|accessdate=2009-08-01|isbn=0665822448}}</ref> is a [[chemical element]]. It is a [[transition metal]], a group of [[metal]]s. It is sometimes considered a [[post-transition metal]]. Its symbol on the [[periodic table]] is "'''Zn'''". Zinc is the 30th element on the periodic table, and has an [[atomic number]] of 30. Zinc has a [[mass number]] of 65.38. It contains 30 [[proton]]s and 30 [[electron]]s. In total, 29 [[isotope]]s of zinc are known, and five of these occur in nature. Some isotopes are [[radioactive decay|radioactive]]. Their [[half-life (element)|half-lives]] are between 40 [[millisecond]]s for <sup>57</sup>Zn and 5x10<sup>18</sup> years for <sup>70</sup>Zn.

Zinc is a metal that is mostly used for [[galvanizing]] and [[battery|batteries]]. It is the fourth most common metal.

==Properties==
===Physical properties===
Zinc is a shiny bluish grey metal. When it has just been cut, zinc has a whitish-grey color. If it is exposed to [[air]], it will not stay shiny for long. Its melting point is at ({{convert|419.58|C|F}}) and boiling point is ({{convert|907.0|C|F}}). This temperature is lower than most [[transition metal]]s but higher than [[tin]] or [[lead]]. It can be melted on a cooking stove. It boils at a low temperature for a metal.<ref name=ZincMetalProps>{{Citation| url=http://www.galvanizeit.org/aga/designing-fabricating/design-considerations/zinc-metal-properties|title=Zinc Metal Properties|publisher=American Galvanizers Association|year=2008|accessdate=2009-02-15}}</ref> It is not magnetic. When heated a little, it becomes very flexible. If it is heated more, it becomes very [[wikt:brittle|brittle]].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://books.google.com/?id=SSkKAAAAIAAJ|title=The Useful Metals and Their Alloys|first=John|last=Scoffern|publisher=Houlston and Wright|year=1861|pages=591–603|accessdate=2009-04-06}}</ref> It forms [[alloy]]s easily with other metals.

===Chemical properties===
Zinc is a [[reactive]] metal. It is about as reactive as [[aluminium]] and more reactive than most of the more common metals, such as [[iron]], [[copper]], [[nickel]], and [[chromium|chrome]]. It is less reactive than [[magnesium]]. Zinc can react with [[acid]]s, [[base (chemistry)|bases]], and [[nonmetal]]s.<ref>{{Citation|last=Hinds|first=John Iredelle Dillard|title=Inorganic Chemistry: With the Elements of Physical and Theoretical Chemistry|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|year=1908|edition=2nd|pages=506–508|url=http://books.google.com/?id=xMUMAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> It does not rust in air, though. A coating of [[zinc oxide]] and [[zinc carbonate]] forms on the surface of the zinc when it is in air.<ref>{{Citation|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|page=121|isbn=0824792130|title=Corrosion Resistance of Zinc and Zinc Alloys| first=Frank C.|last=Porter}}</ref> This coating stops corrosion. Acids can dissolve this coating and react with the zinc metal.<ref name="Holl">{{Citation|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1985|edition=91–100| pages=1034–1041|isbn=3110075113|title=Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first=Arnold F.|last=Holleman|coauthors=Wiberg, Egon; Wiberg, Nils;|language=German|chapter=Zink}}</ref> This reaction of zinc with an acid makes a zinc(II) salt such as [[zinc chloride]] and [[hydrogen]] gas. This is a very common chemical reaction. The reaction below is the reaction with [[hydrochloric acid]].

:Zn + 2HCl → ZnCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>
[[File:Zinc burning.JPG|thumb|Zinc burning]]
Zinc can burn when powdered or in small pieces to make zinc oxide, a white powder. The flame is bright blue-green.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scorecard.org/chemical-profiles/html/zinc.html |title= Zinc--overview|author= |date= |work= |publisher=chemistryexplained.com |accessdate=2010-11-07}}</ref>

: 2 Zn + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 ZnO

Zinc oxide can [[Solvation|dissolve]] in strong bases. This reaction happens in some batteries that have zinc in them.

: ZnO + H<sub>2</sub>O + 2 OH<sup>-</sup> → Zn(OH)<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>.

Zinc is a [[chalcophile]]. This means that it would rather react with sulfur and elements below it on the periodic table than oxygen. That is why zinc sulfide is the most common zinc ore, not zinc oxide.

===Chemical compounds===
{{See also|:Category:Zinc compounds}}
Zinc can make chemical compounds with other elements. These chemical compounds are only in one [[oxidation state]]: +2. A +1 compound has been found but it is hard to make. There are no other oxidation states other than +1 or +2.<ref>{{Citation|last=Brady|first=James E.|coauthors=Humiston, Gerard E.; Heikkinen, Henry|title=General Chemistry: Principles and Structure|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=1983|edition=3rd|page=671|isbn=047186739X}}</ref> Most of these compounds have no color. If they have a color, it is not the zinc that is making the color.

[[Zinc chloride]] is one of the most common zinc compounds. They are quite unreactive. They are a little acidic when dissolved in water. They make a green flame when heated in a fire.

Other zinc compounds are:
*[[Zinc antimonide]], gray semiconductor
*[[Zinc arsenide]], orange semiconductor
*[[Zinc bromide]], a shield against radiation
*[[Zinc carbonate]], ore of zinc
*[[Zinc fluoride]]
*[[Zinc hydroxide]], used in surgical bandages
*[[Zinc iodide]], used in X-ray picture-taking
*[[Zinc nitrate]], used as a mordant
*[[Zinc oxide]], used in sunscreen
*[[Zinc phosphate]], used in dentistry
*[[Zinc sulfate]], used in pigments
*[[Zinc sulfide]], common zinc ore

==Where zinc is found==

Five [[isotope]]s of zinc are found in nature. <sup>64</sup>Zn is the most common isotope, with 48.63% of naturally occurring Zinc.<ref name="NNDC">{{Citation|url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/|author=NNDC contributors|editor=Alejandro A.

The other isotopes found in nature are {{chem|66|Zn}} (28%), {{chem|67|Zn}} (4%) and {{chem|68|Zn}} (19%).

[[File:Sphalerite.jpg|thumb|Sphalerite, a common zinc ore]]
Zinc is not found as a metal in the earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]]. Zinc is only found as zinc compounds. [[Sphalerite]], a [[mineral]] that is made of [[zinc sulfide]], is a main [[ore]] of zinc. Very little zinc is in the ocean. Zinc ore is normally found with copper and lead ores.

There are some other zinc ores, such as [[smithsonite]] (zinc carbonate) and a zinc [[silicate]] mineral. They are less common.

==Preparation==
The zinc sulfide is concentrated by [[flotation]]. There is a [[detergent]] that collects the zinc sulfide. The impurities sink to the bottom and are removed. Then the zinc sulfide is heated in air to make zinc oxide and [[sulfur dioxide]].<ref name="Zinchand">{{Citation|url=http://books.google.com/?id=laACw9i0D_wC|title=Zinc Handbook|first=Frank C.|last=Porter|publisher=CRC Press|year=1991|isbn=9780824783402}}</ref>

:2 ZnS + 3 O<sub>2</sub> → 2 ZnO + 2 SO<sub>2</sub>

The sulfur dioxide is oxidized to [[sulfur trioxide]].

:2 SO<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2 SO<sub>3</sub>

The sulfur trioxide reacts with the zinc oxide to make zinc sulfate.<ref>{{Citation|title=Hydrometallurgy in Extraction Processes|last=Gupta|first=C. K.|coauthors=Mukherjee, T. K.|page=62|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0849368049|year=1990}}</ref> This makes a [[Solubility|soluble]] form of zinc which can be processed more.
:SO<sub>3</sub> + ZnO → ZnSO<sub>4</sub>

The zinc sulfate is purified and [[electrolysis|electrolyzed]].<ref name="Zinchand"/> This electrolysis makes [[oxygen]], zinc, and [[sulfuric acid]]. This makes a pure zinc that is known as "SHG" or special high grade.<ref>{{Citation|title=Special High Grade Zinc (SHG) 99.995%|url=http://nyrstar.com/nyrstar/en/products/zinccongalvanising/techdownloads/shg_budel.pdf|format=PDF| accessdate=2008-12-01|year=2008|publisher=Nyrstar}}</ref>

:2 ZnSO<sub>4</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O → 2 Zn + 2 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>

The sulfuric acid is reused in place of the sulfur trioxide to leach more zinc oxide.

Zinc oxide can also be [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced]] by [[carbon]] to zinc metal and carbon dioxide at high temperatures.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bodsworth|first=Colin|title=The Extraction and Refining of Metals|page=148|year=1994|isbn=0849344336|publisher=CRC Press}}</ref> This is a [[blast furnace]] process similar to how [[iron]] is made.

Zinc is used in alloys. [[Brass]] is an alloy of [[copper]] and zinc. Brass is the most common zinc alloy. Zinc can form alloys with many other metals. [[Zinc aluminium]] is an alloy of zinc and aluminium, which makes good [[bearing]]s. [[wikt:commercial|Commercial]] [[bronze]] has zinc in it. Sometimes [[cadmium telluride]] is reacted with zinc to make cadmium zinc telluride, a [[semiconductor]]. [[Nickel silver]] is another zinc alloy.

About 1/4 of zinc is used to make zinc compounds. Zinc oxide can be used for [[sunscreen]] or paint [[pigment]]. Zinc oxide also is a [[semiconductor]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Zhang|first=Xiaoge Gregory|title=Corrosion and Electrochemistry of Zinc|publisher=Springer|year=1996|page=93|isbn=0306453347|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Qmf4VsriAtMC}}</ref> Zinc chloride is used to preserve wood so it does not rot.<ref>{{Citation|title=Wood preservatives|last=Blew|first=Joseph Oscar|year=1953|publisher=Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Products Laboratory|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1957/816}}</ref> Some [[fungicide]]s have zinc in them. Zinc sulfate is used in dyes and pigments. Zinc sulfide is used in [[fluorescent bulb]]s to convert the [[ultraviolet]] light to visible light.

Large amounts of zinc metal are [[toxic]]. It can dissolve in stomach acid. When too much zinc is eaten, copper and iron levels go down in the body.

'''Zebra'''s are [[mammal]]s of the [[family (biology)|family]] ''[[Equidae]]''. Zebras are [[horse]]s, and live in [[Africa]]. They are in the same [[genus]] as the common horse, ''[[Equus caballus]]'', and [[donkey]]s. Zebras are known for having many black and white stripes. There are three main [[species]] of zebra, Grevy's Zebra, the Plains Zebra, and the Mountain Zebra. In 2004, new research led to reclassifying zebra subspecies.

==Appearance==
All zebras have very short [[fur]] because they live in hot areas. Their fur has black and white stripes. The main part of the body has mostly vertical stripes, and the legs have horizontal stripes. They also have a dark line down their back. Each of the different zebra species has a different type of stripes. Each zebra has a unique pattern of stripes.

==Life==
Zebras live in families with one male and lots of females. They can have babies (foals) when they are about five years old and can have one foal every year. Zebras mainly eat grass, but they also eat fruit, leaves and some vegetables. They always live near water. They are endangered, and the number of zebras is dropping.

Zebras live naturally in [[Africa]], south of the [[Sahara]] desert.

[[Category:Equids]][[File:Tiergarten Schoenbrunn overview.jpg|thumb|200px|The "Tiergarten Schönbrunn", [[Vienna]], was founded in [[1752]] and is the oldest still existing zoo.]]

A '''zoological garden''', '''zoological park''', or '''zoo''' is a place where many different [[species]] (types) of [[animals]] are kept so people can see and watch them.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/zoo|title=Zoo|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2009-08-25}}</ref>

Modern zoos try not only to be for people's [[entertainment]], but for [[education]], [[research]], and the conservation and protection of animals. Many zoos are centers where rare animals are preserved when they are in danger of [[extinction|dying out]].
These modern zoos also want to give the animals a natural life, so that they are [[health]]y and behave normal. This is done for the animals, but also that people can see the animals as if they were in nature, and not in a zoo.

In order to help thoroughly educate the public on the biological diversity that makes up the world, it is crucial that zoos receive the proper funding necessary.  Proper funds allow the process of people and wildlife successfully coexisting to be able to continue. With the ability to pursue continuing research and education for people about the world around them, preservation of crucial natural resources is made more of a reality. Funds also work to ensure zoos can provide the most natural environment possible for wildlife in its care. 

In the past, but also today, there are a lot of zoos that are not like the modern type of zoo. There the animals are held in very bad conditions. They are kept in small cages, and they are bored and get sick.
